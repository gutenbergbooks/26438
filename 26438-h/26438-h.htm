<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">My</span> warmest thanks are due to Mr. Francis
Darwin, to Mr. E. B. Poulton (whose interest in
the subject here discussed is shown by his share
in the translation of Weismann's <i>Essays on
Heredity</i>), and to Professor Romanes, for the help
afforded by their kindly suggestions and criticisms,
and for the advice and recommendation under
which this essay is now published. Encouragement
from Mr. Francis Darwin is to me the more
precious, and the more worthy of grateful recognition,
from the fact that my general conclusion
that acquired characters are <i>not</i> inherited is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
at variance with the opinion of his revered father,
who aided his great theory by the retention of
some remains of Lamarck's doctrine of the inherited
effect of habit. I feel as if the son, as
representative of his great progenitor, were carrying
out the idea of an appreciative editor who
writes to me: "We must say that if Darwin were
still alive, he would find your arguments of great
weight, and undoubtedly would give to them the
serious consideration which they deserve." I
hope, then, that I may be acquitted of undue
presumption in opposing a view sanctioned by
the author of the <i>Origin of Species</i>, but already
stoutly questioned and firmly rejected by such
followers of his as Weismann, Wallace, Poulton,
Ray Lankester, and others, to say nothing of its
practical rejection by so great an authority on
heredity as Francis Galton.</p>

<p>The sociological importance of the subject has
already been insisted on in emphatic terms by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Mr. Herbert Spencer, and this importance may
be even greater than he imagined.</p>

<p>Civilization largely sets aside the harsh but
ultimately salutary action of the great law of
Natural Selection without providing an efficient
substitute for preventing degeneracy. The substitute
on which moralists and legislators rely&mdash;if
they think on the matter at all&mdash;is the
cumulative inheritance of the beneficial effects of
education, training, habits, institutions, and so
forth&mdash;the inheritance, in short, of acquired
characters, or of the effects of use and disuse.
If this substitute is but a broken reed, then the
deeper thinkers who gradually teach the teachers
of the people, and ultimately even influence the
legislators and moralists, must found their
systems of morality and their criticisms of social
and political laws and institutions and customs
and ideas on the basis of the Darwinian law
rather than on that of Lamarck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Looking forward to the hope that the human
race may become consciously and increasingly
master of itself and of its destiny, and recognizing
the Darwinian principle of the selection
of the fittest as the <i>only</i> means of preventing the
moral and physical degeneracy which, like an internal
dry rot, has hitherto been the besetting
danger of all civilizations, I desire that the
thinkers who mould the opinions of mankind shall
not be led astray from the true path of enduring
progress and happiness by reliance on fallacious
beliefs which will not bear examination. Such, at
least, is the feeling or motive which has prompted
me to devote much time and thought to a difficult
but important inquiry in a debatable region of
inference and conjecture, where (I am afraid)
evidence on either side can never be absolutely
conclusive, and where, especially, the absolute
demonstration of a universal negative cannot
reasonably be expected.</p>

<h1>ARE THE EFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE INHERITED?</h1>

<h2>IMPORTANCE AND BEARING OF THE INQUIRY.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> question whether the effects of use and
disuse are inherited, or, in other words, whether
acquired characters are hereditary, is of considerable
interest to the general student of
evolution; but it is, or should be, a matter of
far deeper interest to the thoughtful philanthropist
who desires to ensure the permanent
welfare and happiness of the human race. So<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
profoundly important, in fact, are the moral,
social, and political conclusions that depend on
the answer to this inquiry, that, as Mr. Herbert
Spencer rightly says, it "demands, beyond all
other questions whatsoever, the attention of
scientific men."</p>

<p>It is obvious that we can produce important
changes in the individual. We can, for example,
improve his muscles by athletics, and his brain
by education. The use of organs enlarges and
strengthens them; the disuse of parts or faculties
weakens them. And so great is the power of habit
that it is proverbially spoken of as "second
nature." It is thus certain that we can modify
the individual. We can strengthen (or weaken)
his body; we can improve (or deteriorate) his
intellect, his habits, his morals. But there
remains the still more important question which
we are about to consider. Will such modifications
be inherited by the offspring of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
modified individual? Does individual improvement
transmit itself to descendants independently
of personal teaching and example? Have
artificially produced changes of structure or habit
any inherent tendency to become congenitally
transmissible and to be converted in time into
fixed traits of constitution or character? Can the
philanthropist rely on such a tendency as a hopeful
factor in the evolution of mankind?&mdash;the only
sound and stable basis of a higher and happier
state of things being, as he knows or ought to
know, the innate and constitutionally-fixed improvement
of the race as a whole. If acquired
modifications are impressed on the offspring and
on the race, the systematic moral training of
individuals will in time produce a constitutionally
moral race, and we may hope to improve mankind
even in defiance of the unnatural selection by which
a spurious but highly popular philanthropy would
systematically favour the survival of the unfittest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and the rapid multiplication of the worst.
But if acquired modifications do not tend to be
transmitted, if the use or disuse of organs
or faculties does not similarly affect posterity
by inheritance, then it is evident that no
innate improvement in the race can take
place without the aid of natural or artificial
selection.</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer maintains that the effects of
use and disuse <i>are</i> inherited in kind, and in his
<i>Factors of Organic Evolution</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he has supported
his contention with a selection of facts and reasonings
which I shall have the temerity to examine
and criticize. Darwin also held the same view,
though not so strongly. And here, to prevent
misunderstanding, I may say that the admiration
and reverence and gratitude due to Darwin ought
not to be allowed to interfere in the slightest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
degree with the freest criticism of his conclusions.
To perfect his work by the correction of
really extraneous errors is as much a sacred duty
as to study and apply the great truths he has
taught.</p>

<h2>SPENCER'S EXAMPLES AND ARGUMENTS.</h2>

<h3>DIMINUTION OF THE JAWS IN CIVILIZED RACES.</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Mr. Spencer</span> verified this by comparing English
jaws with Australian and Negro jaws at the College
of Surgeons.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He maintains that the diminution
of the jaw in civilized races can <i>only</i> have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
brought about by inheritance of the effects of
lessened use. But if English jaws are lighter
and thinner than those of Australians and
Negroes, so too is the rest of the skull. As
the diminution in the weight and thickness of
the walls of the cranium cannot well be ascribed
to disuse, it must be attributed to some other
cause; and this cause may have affected the jaw
also. Cessation of the process by which natural
selection<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> favoured strong thick bones during
ages of brutal violence might bring about a
change in this direction. Lightness of structure,
facilitating agility and being economical of
material, would also be favoured by natural
selection so far as strength was not too
seriously diminished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>Sexual selection powerfully affects the human
face, and so must affect the jaws&mdash;as is shown by
the differences between male and female jaws,
and by the relative lightness and smallness of
the latter, especially in the higher races. Human
preference, both sexual and social, would tend
to eliminate huge jaws and ferocious teeth when
these were no longer needed as weapons of war
or organs of prehension, &amp;c. We can hardly
assume that the lower half of the face is specially
exempt from the influence of natural and sexual
selection; and the effects of these undoubted
factors of evolution must be fully considered
before we are entitled to call in the aid of a
factor whose existence is questioned.</p>

<p>After allowing for lost teeth and the consequent
alveolar absorption, and for a reduction
proportional to that shown in the rest of the
skull, the difference in average weight in fifty
European and fourteen Australian male jaws<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
at the College of Surgeons turned out to be
less than a fifth of an ounce, or about
5 per cent. This slight reduction may be
much more than accounted for by such causes
as disuse in the individual, human preference
setting back the teeth, and partial transference
of the much more marked diminution seen in
female jaws. There is apparently no room for
accumulated <i>inherited</i> effects of ancestral disuse.
The number of jaws is small, indeed; but weighing
them is at least more decisive than Mr.
Spencer's mere inspection.</p>

<p>The differences between Anglo-Saxon male
jaws and Australian and Tasmanian jaws are
most easily explained as effects of human preference
and natural selection. We can hardly
suppose that disuse would maintain or develop
the projecting chin, increase its perpendicular
height till the jaw is deepest and strongest at
its extremity, evolve a side flange, and enlarge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the upper jaw-bone to form part of a more
prominent nose, while drawing back the savagely
obtrusive teeth and lips to a more pleasing
and subdued position of retirement and of
humanized beauty. If human preference and
natural selection caused some of these differences,
why are they incompetent to effect changes in
the direction of a diminution of the jaw or teeth?
And if use and disuse are the sole modifying
agents in the case of the human jaw, why
should men have any more chin than a gorilla
or a dog?</p>

<p>The excessive weight of the West African jaws
at the College of Surgeons is partly <i>against</i>
Mr. Spencer's contention, unless he assumes that
Guinea Negroes use their jaws far more than the
Australians, a supposition which seems extremely
improbable. The heavier skull and narrower
molar teeth point however to other factors than
increased use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The striking variability of the human jaw is
strongly opposed to the idea of its being under
the direct and dominant control of so uniform a
cause as ancestral use and disuse. Mr. Spencer
regards a variation of 1 oz. as a large one, but I
found that the English jaws in the College of
Surgeons varied from 1&middot;9 oz. to 4&middot;3 oz. (or 5 oz.
if lost teeth were allowed for); Australian jaws
varied from 2 oz. to 4&middot;5 oz. (with <i>no</i> lost teeth to
allow for); while in Negro jaws the maximum
rose to over 5&frac12; oz.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In spite of disuse some
European jaws were twice as heavy as the lightest
Australian jaw, either absolutely or (in some
cases) relatively to the cranium. The uniformity
of change relied upon by Mr. Spencer is scarcely
borne out by the facts so far as male jaws are
concerned. The great reduction in the weight
of <i>female</i> jaws <i>and skulls</i> evidently points to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sexual selection and to panmixia under male
protection.</p>

<p>I think, on the whole, we must conclude that
the human jaws do not afford satisfactory proof
of the inheritance of the effects of use and disuse,
inasmuch as the differences in their weight and
shape and size can be more reasonably and consistently
accounted for as the result of less
disputable causes.</p>

<h3>DIMINISHED BITING MUSCLES OF LAP-DOGS.</h3>

<p>The next example, the reduced biting muscles,
&amp;c., of lap-dogs is also unsatisfactory as a proof
of the inheritance of the effects of disuse; for
the change can readily be accounted for without
the introduction of such a factor. The previous
natural selection of strong jaws and teeth and
muscles is reversed. The conscious or unconscious
selection of lap-dogs with the least tendency to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
bite would easily bring about a general enfeeblement
of the whole biting apparatus&mdash;weakness
of the parts concerned favouring harmlessness.
Mr. Spencer maintains that the dwindling of the
parts concerned in clenching the jaw is certainly
not due to artificial selection because the modifications
offer no appreciable external signs. Surely
hard biting is sufficiently appreciable by the
person bitten without any visual admeasurement
of the masseter muscles or the zygomatic arches.
Disuse during lifetime would also cause some
amount of degeneracy; and I am not sure that
Mr. Spencer is right in <i>entirely</i> excluding economy
of nutrition from the problem. Breeders would
not over-feed these dogs; and the puppies that
grew most rapidly would usually be favoured.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<h3>CROWDED TEETH.</h3>

<p>The too closely-packed teeth in the "decreasing"
jaws of modern men (p. 13)<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> are also suggestive
of other causes than use and disuse. Why is there
not simultaneous variation in teeth and jaws, if
disuse is the governing factor? Are we to suppose
that the size of the human teeth is maintained
by use at the same time that the jaws are being
diminished by disuse? Mr. Spencer acknowledges
that the crowding of bull-dogs' and lap-dogs'
teeth is caused by the artificial selection of shortened
jaws. If a similar change is really occurring in
man, could it not be similarly explained by some
factor, such as sexual selection, which might
affect the outward appearance at the cost of
less obvious defects or inconveniences?</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer points to the decay of modern teeth
as a sign or result of their being overcrowded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
through the diminution of the jaw by disuse.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
But the teeth which are the most frequently overcrowded
are the lower incisors. The upper incisors
are less overcrowded, being commonly pressed
outwards by the lower arc of teeth fitting inside
them in biting. The lower incisors are correspondingly
pressed inwards and closer together. Yet the
upper incisors decay&mdash;or at least are extracted&mdash;about
twenty times as frequently as the closely
packed lower incisors.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Surely this must indicate
that the cause of decay is not overcrowding.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p><p>The lateness and irregularity of the wisdom teeth
are sometimes supposed to indicate their gradual
disappearance through want of room in a diminishing
jaw. But a note on Tasmanian skulls in the
<i>Catalogue of the College of Surgeons</i> (p. 199) shows
that this lateness and irregularity have been common
among Tasmanians as well as among civilized
races, so that the change can hardly be attributed
to the effects of disuse under civilization.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h3>BLIND CAVE-CRABS.</h3>

<p>The cave-crabs which have lost their disused
eyes but <i>not the disused eye-stalks</i> appear to illustrate
the effects of natural selection rather than
of disuse. The loss of the exposed, sensitive, and
worse-than-useless eye, would be a decided gain,
while the disused eye-stalk, being no particular
detriment to the crab, would be but slightly
affected by natural selection, though open to the
cumulative effects of disuse. The disused but
better protected eyes of the blind cave-rat are
still "of large size" (<i>Origin of Species</i>, p. 110).</p>

<h3>NO CONCOMITANT VARIATION FROM
CONCOMITANT DISUSE.</h3>

<p>It is but fair to add that these instances of the
cave-crab's eye-stalk and the closely-packed teeth
are put forward by Mr. Spencer with the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
immediate object of proving that there is "no
concomitant variation in co-operative parts," even
when "formed out of the same tissue, like the
crab's eye and its peduncle" (pp. 12-14, 23, 33).
It escapes his notice, however, that in two out
of his three cases it is <i>disuse</i>, or <i>diminished
use</i>, which fails to cause concomitant variation or
proportionate variation.</p>

<h3>THE GIRAFFE, AND NECESSITY FOR
CONCOMITANT VARIATION.</h3>

<p>Having unwittingly shown that lessened use of
closely-connected and co-operative parts does not
cause concomitant variation in these parts, Mr.
Spencer concludes that the concomitant variation
requisite for evolution can only be caused
by altered degrees of use or disuse. He elaborately
argues that the many co-ordinated modifications
of parts necessitated by each important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
alteration in an animal are so complex that they
cannot possibly be brought about except by
the inherited effect of the use and disuse of the
various parts concerned. He holds, for instance,
that natural selection is inadequate to effect
the numerous concomitant changes necessitated
by such developments as that of the long neck
of the giraffe. Darwin, however, on the contrary,
holds that natural selection alone "would have
sufficed for the production of this remarkable
quadruped."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> He is surprised at Mr. Spencer's
view that natural selection can do so little in
modifying the higher animals. Thus one of the
chief arguments with which Mr. Spencer supports
his theory is so poorly founded as to be rejected by
a far greater authority on such subjects. All that
is needed is that natural selection should preserve
the tallest giraffes through times of famine by their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
being able to reach otherwise inaccessible stores of
foliage. The continual variability of all parts of
the higher animals gives scope for innumerable
changes, and Nature is not in a hurry. Mr.
Spencer, however, says that "the chances against
any adequate readjustments fortuitously arising
must be infinity to one." But he has also shown
that altered degree of use does not cause the
needed concomitant variation of co-operative
parts. So the chances against a beneficial change
in an animal must be, at a liberal estimate, infinity
to two. Mr. Spencer, if he has proved anything,
has proved that it is practically impossible that
the giraffe can have acquired a long neck, or the
elk its huge horns, or that any species has ever
acquired any important modification.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace, in his <i>Darwinism</i>, answers Mr.
Spencer by a collection of facts showing that
"variation is the rule," that the range of variation
in wild animals and plants is much greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
than was supposed, and that "each part varies
to a considerable extent independently" of other
parts, so that "the materials constantly ready
for natural selection to act upon are abundant in
quantity and very varied in kind." While co-operative
parts would often be more or less
correlated, so that they would tend to vary together,
coincident variation is not necessary. The
lengthened wing might be gained in one generation,
and the strengthened muscle at a subsequent
period; the bird in the meanwhile drawing
upon its surplus energy, aided (as I would suggest)
by the strengthening effect of increased use in
the individual. Seeing that artificial selection
of complicated variations has modified animals
in many points either simultaneously or by slow
steps, as with otter-sheep, fancy pigeons, &amp;c.
(many of the characters thus obtained being
clearly independent of use and disuse), natural
selection must be credited with similar powers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and Mr. Wallace concludes that Mr. Spencer's
insuperable difficulty is "wholly imaginary."</p>

<p>The extract concerning a somewhat similar
"class of difficulties," which Mr. Spencer quotes
from his <i>Principles of Biology</i>, is faulty in its
reasoning,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> though legitimate in its conclusion
concerning the increasing difficulty of evolution
in proportion with the increasing number and
complexity of faculties to be evolved. But this
increasing difficulty of complex evolution is only
overcome by <i>some</i> favourably-varying individuals
and species&mdash;not by all. And as the difficulty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
increases we find neglect and decay of the less-needed
faculties&mdash;as with domesticated animals
and civilized men, who lose in one direction while
they gain in another. The increasing difficulty
of complex evolution by natural selection is no
proof whatever of use-inheritance<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> except to those
who confound difficulty with impossibility.</p>

<h3>ALLEGED RUINOUS EFFECTS OF NATURAL
SELECTION.</h3>

<p>Mr. Spencer further contends that natural selection,
by unduly developing specially advantageous
modifications without the necessary but complex
secondary modifications, would render the constitution<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of a variety "unworkable" (p. 23). But this
seems hardly feasible, seeing that natural selection
must continually favour the most workable constitutions,
and will only preserve organisms in proportion
as they combine general workableness
with the special modification. On the other hand,
according to Mr. Spencer himself, use-inheritance
must often disturb the balance of the constitution.
Thus it tends to make the jaws and teeth unworkable
through the overcrowding and decay of the
teeth&mdash;there being, as his illustrations show, no
simultaneous or concomitant or proportional
variation in relation to altered degree of use
or disuse.</p>

<h3>ADVERSE CASE OF NEUTER INSECTS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Spencer also holds that most mental
phenomena, especially where complex or social
or moral, can only be explained as arising from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
use-inheritance, which becomes more and more
important as a factor of evolution as we advance
from the vegetable world and the lower grades
of animal life to the more complex activities,
tastes, and habits of the higher organizations
(preface, and p. 74). But there happens to be a
tolerably clear proof that such changes as the
evolution of complicated structures and habits
and social instincts <i>can</i> take place independently
of use-inheritance. The wonderful instincts of the
working bees have apparently been evolved
(at least in all their later social complications
and developments) without the aid of use-inheritance&mdash;nay,
in spite of its utmost opposition.
Working bees, being infertile "neuters," cannot
as a rule transmit their own modifications and
habits. They are descended from countless
generations of queen bees and drones, whose habits
have been widely different from those of the
workers, and whose structures are dissimilar in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
various respects. In many species of ants there
are two, and in the leaf-cutting ants of Brazil
there are <i>three</i>, kinds of neuters which differ from
each other and from their male and female
ancestors "to an almost incredible degree."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
soldier caste is distinguished from the workers
by enormously large heads, very powerful mandibles,
and "extraordinarily different" instincts.
In the driver ant of West Africa one kind
of neuter is three times the size of the other,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and has jaws nearly five times as long. In
another case "the workers of one caste alone carry
a wonderful sort of shield on their heads." One of
the three neuter classes in the leaf-cutting ants
has a single eye in the midst of its forehead.
In certain Mexican and Australian ants some of
the neuters have huge spherical abdomens, which
serve as living reservoirs of honey for the use
of the community. In the equally wonderful
case of the termites, or so-called "white ants"
(which belong, however, to an entirely different
order of insect from the ants and bees) the neuters
are blind and wingless, and are divided into
soldiers and workers, each class possessing the
requisite instincts and structures adapting it
for its tasks. Seeing that natural selection can
form and maintain the various structures and
the exceedingly complicated instincts of ants and
bees and wasps and termites in direct defiance
of the alleged tendency to use-inheritance, surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
we may believe that natural selection, unopposed
by use-inheritance, is equally competent for
the work of complex or social or mental evolution
in the many cases where the strong presumptive
evidence cannot be rendered almost indisputable
by the exceptional exclusion of the modified
animal from the work of reproduction.</p>

<p>Ants and bees seem to be capable of altering
their habits and methods of action much as men
do. Bees taken to Australia cease to store
honey after a few years' experience of the mild
winters. Whole communities of bees sometimes
take to theft, and live by plundering hives, first
killing the queen to create dismay among the
workers. Slave ants attend devotedly to their
captors, and fight against their own species.
Forel reared an artificial ant-colony made up
of five different and more or less hostile species.
Why cannot a much more intelligent animal
modify his habits far more rapidly and comprehensively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
without the aid of a factor which is
clearly unnecessary in the case of the more
intelligent of the social insects?</p>

<h3>&AElig;STHETIC FACULTIES.</h3>

<p>The modern development of music and harmony
(p. 19) is undeniable, but why could it only
have been brought about by the help of the
inheritance of the effects of use? Why are
we to suppose that "minor traits" such as the
"&aelig;sthetic perceptions" cannot have been evolved
by natural selection (p. 20) or by sexual selection?
Darwin holds that our musical faculties
were developed by sexual preference long before
the acquisition of speech. He believes that the
"rhythms and cadences of oratory are derived
from previously developed musical powers"&mdash;a
conclusion "exactly opposite" to that arrived at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
by Mr. Spencer.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The emotional susceptibility
to music, and the delicate perceptions needed for
the higher branches of art, were apparently the
work of natural and sexual selection in the long
past. Civilization, with its leisure and wealth
and accumulated knowledge, perfects human
faculties by artificial cultivation, develops and
combines means of enjoyment, and discovers
unsuspected sources of interest and pleasure.
The sense of harmony, modern as it seems to be,
must have been a latent and indirect consequence
of the development of the sense of hearing and of
melody. Use, at least, could never have called
it into existence. Nature favours and develops
enjoyments to a certain extent, for they subserve
self-preservation and sexual and social preference
in innumerable ways. But modern &aelig;sthetic advance
seems to be almost entirely due to the culture
of latent abilities, the formation of complex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
associations, the selection and encouragement of
talent, and the wide diffusion and imitation of the
accumulated products of the well-cultivated genius
of favourably varying individuals. The fact
that uneducated persons do not enjoy the higher
tastes, and the rapidity with which such tastes are
acquired or professed, ought to be sufficient proof
that modern culture is brought about by far
swifter and more potent influences than use-inheritance.
Neither would this hypothetical
factor of evolution materially aid in explaining
the many other rapid changes of habit brought
about by education, custom, and the changed conditions
of civilization generally. Powerful tastes&mdash;as
is incontestably shown in the cases of alcohol and
tobacco&mdash;lie latent for ages, and suddenly become
manifest when suitable conditions arise. Every
discovery, and each step in social and moral evolution,
produces its wide-spreading train of consequences.
I see no reason why use-inheritance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
need be credited with any share in the cumulative
results of the invention of printing and the
steam-engine and gunpowder, or of freedom
and security under representative government, or
of science and art and the partial emancipation
of the mind of man from superstition, or of the
innumerable other improvements or changes that
take place under modern civilization.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer suggests an inquiry whether the
greater powers possessed by eminent musicians
were not mainly due to the inherited effect of
the musical practice of their fathers (p. 19).
But these great musicians inherited far more than
their parents possessed. The excess of their powers
beyond their parents' must surely be attributed
to spontaneous variation; and who shall say that
the rest was in any way due to use-inheritance?
If, too, the superiority of geniuses proves use-inheritance,
why should not the inferiority of
the sons of geniuses prove the existence of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tendency which is the exact opposite of use-inheritance?
But nobody collects facts concerning
the degenerate branches of musical families.
Only the favourably varying branches are noticed,
and a general impression of rapid evolution of
talent is thus produced. Such cases might be
explained, too, by the facts that musical faculty
is strong in both sexes, that musical families
associate together, and that the more gifted members
may intermarry. Great musicians are often
astonishingly precocious. Meyerbeer "played
brilliantly" at the age of six. Mozart played
beautifully at four. Are we to suppose that the
effect of the <i>adult</i> practice of parents was inherited
at this early age? If use-inheritance was
not necessary in the case of Handel, whose
father was a surgeon, why is it needed to
account for Bach?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<h3>LACK OF EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>The "direct proofs" of use-inheritance are not
as plentiful as might be desired, it appears (pp.
24-28). This acknowledged "lack of recognized
evidence" is indeed the weakest feature in the
case, though Mr. Spencer would fain attribute this
lack of direct proof to insufficient investigation
and to the inconspicuous nature of the inheritance
of the modification. But there is an almost
endless abundance of conspicuous examples of
the effects of use and disuse in the individual.
How is it that the subsequent inheritance of these
effects has not been more satisfactorily observed
and investigated? Horse-breeders and others
could profit by such a tendency, and one cannot
help suspecting that the reason they ignore it
must be its practical inefficacy, arising probably
from its weakness, its obscurity and uncertainty
or its non-existence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h3>INHERITED EPILEPSY IN GUINEA-PIGS.</h3>

<p>Brown-S&eacute;quard's discovery that an epileptic
tendency artificially produced by mutilating the
nervous system of a guinea-pig is occasionally
inherited may be a fact of "considerable weight,"
or on the other hand it may be entirely irrelevant.
Cases of this kind strike one as peculiar exceptions
rather than as examples of a general rule or law.
They seem to show that certain morbid conditions
may occasionally affect both the individual and
the reproductive elements or transmissible type
in a similar manner; but then we also know
that such prompt and complete transmission
of an artificial modification is widely different
from the usual rule. Exceptional cases require
exceptional explanations, and are scarcely good
examples of the effect of a general tendency which
in almost all other cases is so inconspicuous in
its immediate effects. Further remarks on this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
inherited epilepsy can be most conveniently
introduced later on in connection with Darwin's
explanation of the inherited mutilation which it
usually accompanies, but which Mr. Spencer does
not mention.</p>

<h3>INHERITED INSANITY AND NERVOUS DISORDERS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Spencer infers that, because insanity is
usually hereditary, and insanity can be artificially
produced by various excesses, therefore this artificially-produced
insanity must also be hereditary
(p. 28). Direct evidence of this conclusion would
be better than a mere inference which may
beg the very question at issue. That the liability
to insanity commonly runs in families is no proof
that strictly non-inherited insanity will subsequently
become hereditary. I think that theories
should be based on facts rather than facts on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
theories, especially when those facts are to be
the basis or proof of a further theory.</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer also points out that he finds among
physicians "the belief that nervous disorders
of a less severe kind are inheritable"&mdash;a general
belief which does not necessarily include the transmission
of purely artificially-produced disorders,
and so misses the point which is really at issue.
He proceeds, however, to state more definitely
that "men who have prostrated their nervous systems
by prolonged overwork or in some other way,
have children more or less prone to nervousness."
The following observations will, I think, warrant
at least a suspension of judgment concerning
this particular form of use-inheritance.</p>

<p>(1) The nervousness is seen in the <i>children</i> at
an early age, although the nervous prostration
from which it is supposed to be derived obviously
occurs in the parent at a much later period of
life. This change in time is contrary to the rule<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of inheritance at corresponding periods; and,
together with the unusual promptness and comparative
completeness of the inheritance, it may
indicate a special injury or deterioration of the
reproductive elements rather than true inheritance.
The healthy brain of early life has failed
to transmit its robust condition. Is use-inheritance,
then, only effective for evil? Does it only
transfer the newly-acquired weakness, and not
the previous long-continued vigour?</p>

<p>(2) Members of nervous families would be liable
to suffer from nervous prostration, and by the
ordinary law of heredity alone would transmit
nervousness to their children.</p>

<p>(3) The shattered nerves or insanity resulting
from alcoholic and other excesses, or from overwork
or trouble, are evidently signs of a grave
constitutional injury which may react upon the
reproductive elements nourished and developed
in that ruined constitution. The deterioration in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
parent and child may often display itself in the
same organs&mdash;those probably which are hereditarily
weakest. Acquired diseases or disorders
thus appear to be transmitted, when all that was
conveyed to the offspring was the exciting cause
of a lowered vitality or disordered action,
together with the ancestral liability to such
diseases under such conditions.</p>

<p>(4) Francis Galton says that "it is hard to find
evidence of the power of the personal structure
to react upon the sexual elements, that is not
open to serious objection." Some of the cases
of apparent inheritance he regards as coincidence
of effect. Thus "the fact that a drunkard will
often have imbecile children, although his offspring
previous to his taking to drink were healthy,"
is an "instance of simultaneous action," and not
of true inheritance. "The alcohol pervades his
tissues, and, of course, affects the germinal
matter in the sexual elements as much as it does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that in his own structural cells, which have led
to an alteration in the quality of his own nerves.
Exactly the same must occur in the case of
many constitutional diseases that have been
acquired by long-continued irregular habits."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3>INDIVIDUAL AND TRANSMISSIBLE TYPE NOT
MODIFIED ALIKE BY THE DIRECT EFFECT OF
CHANGED HABITS OR CONDITIONS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Spencer finds it hard to believe that the
modifications conveyed to offspring are not identical
in tendency with the changes effected in the
parent by altered use or habit (pp. 23-25, 34).
But it is perfectly certain that the two sets of
effects do not necessarily correspond. The
effect of changed habits or conditions on the
individual is often very far from coinciding with
the effects on the reproductive elements or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
transmissible type. The reproductive system is
"extremely sensitive" to very slight changes,
and is often powerfully affected by circumstances
which otherwise have little effect on the individual
(<i>Origin of Species</i>, p. 7). Various animals and
plants become sterile when domesticated or supplied
with too much nourishment. The native Tasmanians
have already become extinct from sterility
caused by greatly changed diet and habits. If,
as Mr. Spencer teaches, continued culture and
brain-work will in time produce lessened fertility
or comparative sterility, we may yet have to be
careful that intellectual development does not
become a species of suicide, and that the
culture of the race does not mean its extinction&mdash;or
at least the extinction of those most
susceptible of culture.</p>

<p>The reproductive elements are also disturbed
and modified in innumerable minor ways.
Changed conditions or habits tend to produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a general "plasticity" of type, the "indefinite
variability" thus caused being apparently irrelevant
to the change, if any, in the individual.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> A vast
number of variations of structure have certainly
arisen independently of similar parental modification
as the preliminary. Whatever first caused
these "spontaneous" congenital variations affected
the reproductive elements quite differently from
the individual. "When a new peculiarity first
appears we can never predict whether it will be
inherited." Many varieties of plants only keep
true from shoots, and not from seed, which is by
no means acted on in the same way as the
individual plant. Seeing that such plants have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<i>two</i> reproductive types, both constant, it is evident
that these cannot both be modified in the
same way as the parent is modified. Many
parental modifications of structure and habit are
certainly not conveyed to neuter ants and bees;
other modifications, which are not seen in the
parents, being conveyed instead. Many other
circumstances tend to show that the individual
and the transmissible type are independent of
each other so far as modifications of parts are
concerned.</p>

<p>It may seem natural to expect the transmission
of an enlarged muscle or a cultivated brain,
but, on the other hand, why should it be unreasonable
to expect that a modification which
was non-congenital in origin should still remain
non-congenital? Why should the non-transmission
of that which was not transmitted be surprising?</p>

<p>Mr. Spencer thinks that the non-transmission
of acquired modifications is incongruous with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
great fact of atavism. But the great law of the
inheritance of that which is a development of
the transmissible type does not necessarily imply
the inheritance of modifications acquired by the
individual. Because English children may inherit
blue eyes and flaxen hair from their Anglo-Saxon
ancestors, it by no means follows that
an Englishman must inherit his father's sunburnt
complexion or smooth-shaven face. Of course
atavism ultimately adopts many instances of
revolt against its sway. But to assume that these
changes of type <i>follow</i> the personal change rather
than cause it, is to assume the whole question at
issue. That like begets like is true as a broad
principle, but it has many exceptions, and the
non-heredity of acquired characters may be one
of them.</p>

it is as yet uncertain in what way civilization predisposes to caries.
But he shows that caries is caused by the lime salts in the teeth
being attacked by <i>acids</i> from decomposing food in crevices, from
artificial drink such as cyder, from sugar, from medicine, and from
vitiated secretions of the mouth. It is evident that in civilized
races natural selection cannot so rigorously insist on sound teeth,
sound constitutions, and <i>protective alkaline</i> saliva. The reaction of
the civilized mouth is often acid, especially when the system is disordered
by dyspepsia or other diseases or forms of ill-health common
under civilization. The main supply of saliva, which is poured
from the cheeks opposite the upper molars, is often acid when in
small quantities. But the submaxillary and sub-lingual saliva
poured out at the foot of the lower incisors and held in the front
part of the jaw as in a spoon, "differs from parotid saliva in being
more alkaline" (Foster's <i>Text Book of Physiology</i>, p. 238; Tomes,
pp. 284, 685). One observer says that the reaction near the lower
incisors is "never acid." Hence (I conclude) the remarkable immunity
of the lower incisors and canines from decay, an immunity
which extends backwards in a lessening degree to the first and
second bicuspids. The close packing of the lower incisors may
assist by preventing the retention of decaying fragments of food.
Sexual selection may promote caries by favouring white teeth, which
are more prone to decay than yellow ones. Acid vitiation of the
mucus might account both for caries and (possibly) for the strange
infertility of some inferior races under civilization.</p></div>

(such as swiftness, keen sight, courage, sagacity, strength, &amp;c.)
cannot be increased by natural selection unless it is "of greater importance,
for the time being, than most of the other attributes";
and that natural selection cannot develop any one superiority when
animals are equally preserved by "other superiorities." But as
natural selection will simultaneously eliminate tendencies to slowness,
blindness, deafness, stupidity, &amp;c., it <i>must</i> favour and improve
many points simultaneously, although no one of them may be of
greater importance than the rest. Of course the more complicated
the evolution the slower it will be; but time is plentiful, and
the amount of elimination is correspondingly vast.</p></div>

<h2>DARWIN'S EXAMPLES.</h2>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> most formidable cases brought forward by
Mr. Spencer are from Darwin. I shall endeavour
to show, however, that Darwin was probably wrong
in retaining the older explanation of these facts,
and that the remains of the Lamarckian theory of
use-inheritance need not any longer encumber
the great explanation which has superseded that
fallacious and unproven theory and has rendered
it totally unnecessary. Meanwhile I think it is an
excellent sign that Mr. Spencer has to complain
that "Nowadays most naturalists are more Darwinian
than Mr. Darwin himself"&mdash;inasmuch as
they are inclined to say that there is "no proof"
that the effects of use and disuse are inherited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Other excellent signs are the recent issue of a translation
of Weismann's important essays on this and
kindred subjects,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the strong support given to his
views by Wallace in his <i>Darwinism</i>, and their
adoption by Ray Lankester in his article on
Zoology in the latest edition of the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i>. So sound and cautious an investigator
as Francis Galton had also in 1875 concluded
that "acquired modifications are barely, if at all,
<i>inherited</i>, in the correct sense of that word."</p>

<p>Darwin's belief in the inheritance of acquired
characters was more or less hereditary in the
family. His grandfather, Erasmus Darwin, anticipated
Lamarck's views in his <i>Zoonomia</i>,
which Darwin at one time "greatly admired."
His father was "convinced" of the "inherited evil
effects of alcohol," and to this extent at least he
strongly impressed the belief in the inheritance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of acquired characters upon his children's minds.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Darwin must also have been imbued with Lamarckian
ideas from other sources, although
Dr. Grant's enthusiastic advocacy entirely failed
to convert him to a belief in evolution.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "Nevertheless,"
he says, "it is probable that the hearing
rather early in life such views maintained and
praised may have favoured my upholding them
under a different form in my <i>Origin of Species</i>"&mdash;a
remark which refers to Lamarck's views on the
general doctrine of evolution, but might also prove
equally true if applied to Darwin's partial retention
of the Lamarckian explanation of that evolution.
Professor Huxley has pointed out that in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Darwin's earlier sketch of his theory of evolution
(1844) he attached more weight to the inheritance
of acquired habits than he does in his
<i>Origin of Species</i> published fifteen years later.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
He appears to have acquired the belief in early
life without first questioning and rigorously testing
it as he would have done had it originated
with himself. In later life it appeared to assist his
theory of evolution in minor points, and in
particular it appeared absolutely indispensable
to him as the <i>only</i> explanation of the diminution
of disused parts in cases where, as in domestic
animals, economy of growth seemed to be practically
powerless. He failed to adequately notice
the effect of panmixia, or the withdrawal of
selection, in causing or allowing degeneracy and
dwindling under disuse; and he hardly attached
sufficient importance to the fact that rudimentary
organs and other supposed effects of use or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
disuse are quite as marked features in neuter
insects which cannot transmit the effects of use
and disuse as they are in the higher animals.</p>

<h3>REDUCED WINGS OF BIRDS OF OCEANIC ISLANDS.</h3>

<p>Darwin himself has pointed out that the rudimentary
wings of island beetles, at first thought
to be due to disuse, are mainly brought about by
natural selection&mdash;the best-winged beetles being
most liable to be blown out to sea. But he says
that in birds of the oceanic islands "not persecuted
by any enemies, the reduction of their
wings has probably been caused by disuse." This
explanation may be as fallacious as it is acknowledged
to have been in the case of the island
beetles. According to Darwin's own views,
natural selection <i>must</i> at least have played an
important part in reducing the wings; for he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
holds that "natural selection is continually trying
to economize every part of the organization."
He says: "If under changed conditions of life
a structure, before useful, becomes less useful, its
diminution will be favoured, for it will profit the
individual not to have its nutriment wasted in
building up an useless structure.... Thus, as I
believe, natural selection will tend in the long
run to reduce any part of the organization, as
soon as it becomes, through changed habits,
superfluous."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> If, as Darwin powerfully urges
(and he here ignores his usual explanation),
ostriches' wings are insufficient for flight in consequence
of the economy enforced by natural
selection,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> why may not the reduced wings
of the dodo, or the penguin, or the apteryx, or of
the Cursores generally, be wholly attributed to
natural selection in favour of economy of material
and adaptation of parts to changed conditions?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The great principle of economy is continually at
work shaping organisms, as sculptors shape statues,
by removing the superfluous parts; and a mere
glance at the forms of animals in general will
show that it is well-nigh as dominant and universal
a principle as is that of the positive
development of useful parts. Other causes, moreover
besides actual economy, would favour shorter
and more convenient wings on oceanic islands.
In the first place, birds that were somewhat weak
on the wing would be most likely to settle on an
island and stay there. Shortened wings would
then become advantageous because they would
restrain fatal migratory tendencies or useless
and perilous flights in which the birds that flew
furthest would be most often carried away by
storms and adverse winds. Reduced wings would
keep the birds near the shelter and the food
afforded by the island and its neighbourhood,
and in some cases would become adapted to act<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
as fins or flappers for swimming under water in
pursuit of fish.</p>

<p>The reduced size of the wings of these island
birds is paralleled by the remarkable thinness,
&amp;c., of the shell of the "gigantic land-tortoise"
of the Galapagos Islands. The changes seen in
the carapace can hardly have been brought about
by the inherited effects of special disuse. Why
then should not the reduction of equally useless,
more wasteful, and perhaps positively dangerous
wings be also due to an economy which has become
advantageous to bird and reptile alike through
the absence of the mammalian rivals whose places
they are evidently being modified to fill? The
<i>complete</i> loss of the wings in neuter ants and termites
can scarcely be due to the inherited effects
of disuse; and as natural selection has abolished
these wings in spite of the opposition of use-inheritance,
it must clearly be fully competent to
reduce wings without its aid. In considering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
rudimentary wings of the apteryx, or of the moa,
emu, ostrich, &amp;c., we must not forget the frequent
or occasional occurrence of hard seasons, and times
of drought and famine, when Nature eliminates
redundant, wasteful, and ill-adapted organisms in
so severe and wholesale a fashion. Where enemies
are absent there would be unrestrained multiplication,
and this would greatly increase the severity
of the competition for food, and so hasten the
elimination of disused and useless parts.</p>

<h3>DROOPING EARS AND DETERIORATED
INSTINCTS.</h3>

<p>Mr. Galton has pointed out that existing races
and existing organs are only kept at their present
high pitch of organic excellence by the stringent
and incessant action of natural or artificial
selection; and the simple relaxation or withdrawal
of such selective influences will almost necessarily<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
result in a certain amount of deterioration, independently
even of the principle of economy.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> I
think that this cessation of a previous selective
process will account for the drooping&mdash;but <i>not
diminished</i>&mdash;ears of various domesticated animals
(human preference and increased weight evidently
aiding), and also for the inferior instincts seen in
them and in artificially-fed caterpillars of the silk-moth,
which now "often commit the strange mistake
of devouring the base of the leaf on which
they are feeding, and consequently fall down."
Anyhow, I fail to see that anything is proved by
this latter case, except that natural instinct may
be perverted or aborted under unnatural conditions
and a changed method of selection which
abolishes the powerful corrective formerly supplied
by natural selection.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>
<h3>WINGS AND LEGS OF DUCKS AND FOWLS.</h3>

<p>The reduced wings and enlarged legs of domesticated
ducks and fowls are attributed by Darwin and
Spencer to the inheritance of the effects of use and
disuse. But the inference by no means follows.
Natural selection would usually favour these adaptive
changes, and they would also have been aided
by an artificial selection which is often unconscious
or indirect. Birds with diminished power of flight
would be less difficult to keep and manage, and
in preserving and multiplying such birds man would
be unconsciously bringing about structural changes
which would easily be regarded as effects of
use and disuse. "About eighteen centuries ago
Columella and Varro speak of the necessity
of keeping ducks in netted enclosures like other
wild fowl, so that at this period there was danger
of their flying away."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Is it not probable that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
best fliers would escape most frequently, or would
pine most if kept confined? On the other hand,
birds with lessened powers of flight would not be
eliminated as under natural conditions, but would
be favoured; and natural selection, together with
artificial selection of the most flourishing birds,
would thicken and strengthen the legs to meet
increased demands upon them.</p>

<p>The diminution of the duck's wing is not great
even in the birds that "never fly," and from
this we must deduct the direct effect of disuse on
the individual during its lifetime. As Weismann
suggests, the <i>inherited</i> portion of the change could
only be ascertained by comparing the bones, &amp;c.,
of wild and tame ducks <i>similarly reared</i>. If
individual disuse diminished the weight of the
duck's wing-bones by 9 per cent. there would
be nothing left to account for.</p>

<p>I suspect that investigation would reveal anomalies
inconsistent with the theory of use-inheritance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Thus according to Darwin's tables
of comparative weights and measurements<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the
leg-bones of the Penguin duck have slightly
diminished in length, although they have increased
39 per cent. in weight. Relatively to
the weight of the skeleton, the leg-bones have
shortened in the tame breeds of ducks by over
5 per cent. (and in two breeds by over 8 per cent.)
although they have increased more than 28 per
cent. in proportional weight.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> How can increased
use simultaneously shorten and thicken these bones?
If the relative shortening is attributed to a heavier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
skeleton, then the apparently reduced weight of
the wing-bones is fully accounted for by the same
circumstance, and disuse has had no inherited
effect.</p>

<p>Another strange circumstance is that the wing-bones
have diminished <i>in length only</i>. The shortening
is about 6 per cent. more than in the shortened
legs, and it amounts to 11 per cent. as compared
with the weight of the skeleton. Such a shortening
should represent a reduction of 29 per cent. in
weight, whereas the actual reduction in the weight
of the wing-bones relatively to the weight of the
skeleton is only 9 per cent. even in the breeds
that never fly. Independently of shortening, the
disused wing-bones have actually thickened or
increased in weight. In the Aylesbury duck
the disproportion caused by these conflicting
changes is so great that the wing-bones are
47 per cent. heavier than they should be if
their weight had varied proportionally with their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
length.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The reduction in weight on which Darwin
relies seems to be entirely due to the shortening,
and this shortening appears to be irrelevant to
disuse, since the wings of the Call duck are similarly
shortened in their proportions by 12 per cent.,
although this bird habitually flies to such an
extent that Darwin partly attributes the greatly
increased weight of its wing-bones to increased use
under domestication.</p>

<p>We find that <i>all</i> the changes are in the
direction of shorter and thicker bones&mdash;a tendency
which must be largely dependent upon the suspension
of the rigorous elimination which keeps the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
bones of the wild duck <i>long and light</i>. The
used leg-bones and the disused wing-bones have
alike been shortened and thickened, though in
different proportions. Natural or artificial selection
might easily thicken legs without lengthening
them, or shorten wings without eliminating strong
heavy bones, but it can hardly be contended that
use-inheritance has acted in such conflicting ways.
The thickening of the wing-bones has actually
more than kept pace with any increase of weight
in the skeleton, in spite of the effect of individual
disuse and of the alleged cumulative effect
of ancestral disuse for hundreds of generations.
The case of the duck deserves special attention
as a crucial one, if only from the fact that in
this instance, and in this instance only, has Darwin
given the weights of the skeletons, thus furnishing
the means for a closer examination of his details
than is usually possible.</p>

<p>If we ignore such factors as selection, panmixia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
correlation, and the effects of use and
disuse during lifetime, and still regard the case
of the domestic duck as a valid proof of the
inheritance of the effects of use and disuse, we
must also accept it as an equally valid proof that
the effects of use and disuse are <i>not</i> inherited.
Nay, we may even have to admit that, in two
points out of four, the <i>inherited</i> effect of use and
disuse on successive generations is exactly opposite
to the immediate effect on the individual.</p>

<p>Among fowls the wing-bones have lost much
in weight but little or nothing in length&mdash;which is
the reverse of what has occurred in ducks, although
disuse is alleged to be the common cause in both
cases. Some of the fowls which fly least have
their wing-bones as long as ever. In the case of
the Silk and Frizzled fowls&mdash;ancient breeds which
"cannot fly at all"&mdash;and in that of the Cochins,
which "can hardly fly up to a low perch," Darwin
observes "how truly the proportions of an organ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
may be inherited although not fully exercised
during many generations."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In four out of twelve
breeds the wing-bones had become slightly heavier
relatively to the leg-bones. Do not these facts
tend to show that the changes in fowls' wings
are due to fluctuating variability and selective
influences rather than to a general law whereby the
effects of disuse are cumulatively inherited?</p>

<h3>PIGEONS' WINGS.</h3>

<p>Concerning pigeons' wings Darwin says: "As
fancy pigeons are generally confined in aviaries
of moderate size, and as even when not confined
they do not search for their own food, they must
during many generations have used their wings
incomparably less than the wild rock-pigeon ... but
when we turn to the wings we find what at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
first appears a wholly different and unexpected
result."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> This unexpected increase in the spread of
the wings from tip to tip is due to the feathers,
which have lengthened in spite of disuse. Excluding
the feathers, the wings were shorter in seventeen
instances, and longer in eight. But as artificial
selection has lengthened the wings in some
instances, why may it not have shortened
them in others? Wings with shortened bones
would fold up more neatly than the long wings
of the Carrier pigeon for instance, and so might
unconsciously be favoured by fanciers. The
selection of elegant birds with longer necks or
bodies would cause a relative reduction in the
wings&mdash;as with the Pouter, where the wings
have been greatly lengthened but not so
much as the body.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Slender bodies, too, and the
lessened divergence of the furculum,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
slightly diminish the spread of the wings, and so
would affect the measurements taken. As the
wing-bones, moreover, are to some extent correlated
with the beak and the feet, the artificial
selection of shortened beaks might tend to shorten
the wing as well as the feet. Under these
circumstances how can we be sure of the actual
efficacy of use-inheritance? Surely selection is as
fully competent to effect slight changes in the
direction of use-inheritance as it undoubtedly is
to effect great changes in direct opposition to that
alleged factor of evolution.</p>

<h3>SHORTENED BREAST-BONE IN PIGEONS.</h3>

<p>The shortening of the sternum in pigeons is attributed
to disuse of the flight muscles attached to
it. The bone is only shortened by a third of an
inch, but this represents a very remarkable reduction
in proportional length, which Darwin estimates at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
from one-seventh to one-eighth, or over 13 per
cent. This marked reduction, too, quite unlike
the slight reduction of the wing-bones to which
the other ends of the muscles are attached, was
universal in the eleven specimens measured by
Darwin; and the bone, though acknowledged
to have been modified by artificial selection
in some breeds, is not so open to observation as
wings or legs. Even, however, if this relative
shortening of the sternum remained otherwise
inexplicable, it might still be as irrelevant to use
and disuse as is the fact that "many breeds"
of fancy pigeons have lost a rib, having only
seven where the ancestral rock-pigeon has eight.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
But the excessive reduction in the sternum is
far from being inexplicable. In the first place
Darwin has somewhat over-estimated it. Instead
of comparing the deficiency of length with the
increased length which <i>should</i> have been acquired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
(since the pigeons have increased in average size)
he compares it with the length of the breast-bone
in the rock-pigeon.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> By this method if a
pigeon had doubled in dimensions while its
breast-bone remained unaltered, the reduction
would be put down as 100 per cent., whereas
obviously the true reduction would be one-half,
or 50 per cent. of what the bone <i>should be</i>.
Avoiding this error and a minor fallacy besides,
a sound estimate reduces the supposed reduction
of 13 or 14 per cent. to one of 11&middot;7 per cent., which
is still of course a considerable diminution.</p>

<p>Part of this reduction must be due to the direct
effect of disuse during the lifetime of the individual.
Another and perhaps very considerable
part of the relative change must be attributed
to the lengthening of the neck or body by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
artificial selection, or to other modifications of
shape and proportion effected directly or indirectly
by the same cause.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The reduction is greatest in
the Pouter (18&frac12; per cent.) and in the Pied Scanderoon
(17&frac12; per cent.). In the former the body has
been greatly elongated by artificial selection and
three or four additional vertebr&aelig; have been acquired
in the hinder part of the body.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> In the latter a
long neck increases the length of the bird, and so
causes, or helps to cause, the relative shortening of
the breast-bone. In the English Carrier&mdash;which
experiences the effects of disuse, as it is too
valuable to be flown&mdash;the relative reduction of
11 per cent. is apparently more than accounted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
for by the "elongated neck." The Dragon also
has a long neck. In the Pouter, although the
breast-bone has been shortened by 18&frac12; per
cent. relatively to the length of the body, it
has <i>lengthened</i> by 20 per cent. relatively to
the <i>bulk</i> of the body.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Darwin forgot to ask
whether allowance must not be made for a
frequent, or perhaps general, elongation of the
neck and the hinder part of the body, and the
relative shortening or the throwing forward of the
central portion containing the ribs (frequently
one less in number) and the sternum. The whole
body of the pigeon is so much under the control
of artificial selection, that every precaution must
be taken to guard against such possible sources of
error.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p><p>Under domestication there would be a suspension
of the previous elimination of reduced breast-bones
by natural selection (Weismann's panmixia),
and a diminution of the parts concerned in flying
might even be favoured, as lessened powers of
<i>continuous</i> flight would prevent pigeons from straying
too far, and would fit them for domestication
or confinement. Such causes might reduce some of
the less observed parts affected by flying, while
still leaving the wing of full size for occasional
flight, or to suit the requirements of the pigeon-fanciers.
A change might thus be commenced
like that seen in the rudimentary keel of the
sternum in the owl-parrot of New Zealand,
which has lost the power of flight although
still retaining fairly-developed wings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>
<h3>SHORTENED FEET IN PIGEONS.</h3>

<p>Darwin thinks it highly probable that the short
feet of most breeds of pigeons are due to lessened
use, though he owns that the effects of correlation
with the shortened beak are more plainly shown
than the effects of disuse.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> But why need the
inherited effects of disuse be called in to explain
an average reduction of some 5 per cent., when
Darwin's measurements show that in the breeds
where long beaks are favoured the principle of
correlation between these parts has lengthened
the foot by 13 per cent. in spite of disuse?</p>

<h3>SHORTENED LEGS OF RABBITS.</h3>

<p>In the case of the domestic rabbit Darwin
notices that the bones of the legs have (relatively)
become shorter by an inch and a half. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
as the leg-bones have <i>not</i> diminished in relative
weight,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> they must clearly have grown <i>thicker</i>
or denser. If disuse has shortened them, as
Darwin supposes, why has it also thickened them?
The ears and the tail have been lengthened in
spite of disuse. Why then may not the ungainly
hind-legs have been shortened by human preference
independently of the inherited effects of
disuse? By relying on apparently favourable
instances and neglecting the others it would be
easy to arrive at all manner of unsound conclusions.
We might thus become convinced that vessels
tend to sail northwards, or that a pendulum
oscillates more often in one direction than in
the other. It must not be forgotten that it
would be easy to cite an enormous number of
cases which are in direct conflict with the
supposed law of use-inheritance.</p>

<h3>BLIND CAVE-ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>Weak or defective eyesight is by no means
rare as a spontaneous variation in animals,
"the great French veterinary Huzard going
so far as to say that a blind race [of horses]
could soon be formed." Natural selection evolves
blind races whenever eyes are useless or
disadvantageous, as with parasites. This may
apparently be done independently of the effects
of disuse, for certain neuter ants have eyes which
are reduced to a more or less rudimentary
condition, and neuter termites are blind as well
as wingless. In one species of ant (<i>Eciton vastator</i>)
the sockets have disappeared as well as the eyes.
In deep caves not only would natural selection
cease to maintain good eyesight but it would
persistently favour blindness&mdash;or the entire
removal of the eye when greatly exposed, as in
the cave-crab&mdash;and as Dr. Ray Lankester has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
indicated,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> there would have been a previous
selection of animals which through spontaneous
weakness, sensitiveness, or other affection of the
eye found refuge and preservation in the cave,
and a subsequent selection of the descendants
whose fitness for relative darkness led them
deeper into the cave or prevented them from
straying back to the light with its various
dangers and severer competition. Panmixia,
however, as Weismann has shown, would probably
be the most important factor in causing blindness.</p>

<h3>INHERITED HABITS.</h3>

<p>Darwin says: "A horse is trained to certain
paces, and the colt inherits similar consensual
movements."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> But selection of the constitutional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
tendency to these paces, and imitation of the mother
by the colt, may have been the real causes. The
evidence, to be satisfactory, should show that
such influences were excluded. Men acquire
proficiency in swimming, waltzing, walking, smoking,
languages, handicrafts, religious beliefs, &amp;c.,
but the children only appear to inherit the innate
abilities or constitutional proclivities of their
parents. Even the songs of birds, including
their call-notes, are no more inherited than is
language by man (<i>Descent of Man</i>, p. 86). They
are learned from the parent. Nestlings which
acquire the song of a distinct species, "teach
and transmit their new song to their offspring."
If use-inheritance has not fixed the song of birds,
why should we suppose that in a single
generation it has transmitted a newly-taught
method of walking or trotting?</p>

<p>It is alleged that dogs inherit the intelligence
acquired by association with man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and that retrievers inherit the effects of their
training.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But selection and imitation are so
potent that the additional hypothesis of use-inheritance
seems perfectly superfluous. Where
intelligence is not highly valued and carefully
promoted by selection, the intelligence derivable
from association with man does <i>not</i> appear
to be inherited. Lap-dogs, for instance, are often
remarkably stupid.</p>

<p>Darwin also instances the inheritance of dexterity
in seal-catching as a case of use-inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
But this is amply explained by the ordinary
law of heredity. All that is needed is that the
son shall inherit the suitable faculties which the
father inherited before him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h3>TAMENESS OF RABBITS.</h3>

<p>Darwin holds that in some cases selection alone
has modified the instincts and dispositions of
domesticated animals, but that in most cases
selection and the inheritance of acquired habits
have concurred in effecting the change. "On the
other hand," he says, "habit alone in some cases
has sufficed; hardly any animal is more difficult
to tame than the young of the wild rabbit;
scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of
the tame rabbit; but I can hardly suppose that
domestic rabbits have often been selected for
tameness alone; so that we must attribute at least
the greater part of the inherited change from
extreme wildness to extreme tameness to habit
and long-continued close confinement."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>But there are strong, and to me irresistible,
arguments to the contrary. I think that the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
considerations will show that the greater
part, if not the whole, of the change must be
attributed to selection rather than to the direct
inheritance of acquired habit.</p>

<p>(1) For a period which may cover thousands of
generations, there has been an entire cessation of
the natural selection which maintains the wildness
(or excessive fear, caution, activity, &amp;c.) so indispensably
essential for preserving defenceless wild
rabbits of all ages from the many enemies that
prey upon them.</p>

<p>(2) During this same extensive period of time
man has usually killed off the wildest and bred
from the tamest and most manageable. To some
extent he has done this consciously. "It is very
conducive to successful breeding to keep only such
as are quiet and tractable," says an authority on
rabbits,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and he enjoins the selection of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
handsomest and <i>best-tempered</i> does to serve as
breeders. To a still greater extent man has
favoured tameness unconsciously and indirectly.
He has systematically selected the largest and
most prolific animals, and has thus doubled the
size and the fertility of the domestic rabbit. In
consciously selecting the largest and most flourishing
individuals and the best and most prolific
mothers, he <i>must</i> have unconsciously selected
those rabbits whose relative <i>tameness</i> or placidity
of disposition rendered it possible for them to
flourish and to produce and rear large and thriving
families, instead of fretting and pining as the
wilder captives would do. When we consider
how exceedingly delicate and easily disturbed yet
all-important a function is that of maternity in
the continually breeding rabbit, we see that the
tamest and the least terrified would be the most
successful mothers, and so would continually be
selected, although man cared nothing for the tameness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in itself. The tamest mothers would also
be less liable to neglect or devour their offspring,
as rabbits commonly do when their young are
handled too soon, or even when merely frightened
by mice, &amp;c., or disturbed by changed surroundings.</p>

<p>(3) We must remember the extraordinary fecundity
of the rabbit and the excessive amount of
elimination that consequently takes place either
naturally or artificially. Where nature preserved
only the wildest, man has preserved the tamest.
If there is any truth in the Darwinian theory, this
thorough and long-continued reversal of the selective
process <i>must</i> have had a powerful effect.
Why should it not be amply sufficient to account
for the tameness and mental degeneracy of the
rabbit without the aid of a factor which can readily
be shown to be far weaker in its normal action
than either natural or artificial selection? Why
may not the tameness of the rabbit be transferred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to the group of cases in which Darwin holds that
"habit has done nothing," and selection has done
all?</p>

<p>(4) If use-inheritance has tamed the rabbit, why
are the bucks still so mischievous and unruly?
Why is the Angora breed the only one in which
the males show no desire to destroy the young?
Why, too, should use-inheritance be so much more
powerful in the rabbit than with other animals
which are far more easily tamed in the first instance?
Wild young rabbits when domesticated
"remain unconquerably wild," and, although they
may be kept alive, they pine and "rarely come to
any good." Yet the animal which <i>acquires</i> least
tameness&mdash;or apparently, indeed, none at all&mdash;inherits
most! It appears, in fact, to inherit that
which it cannot acquire&mdash;a circumstance which
indicates the selection of spontaneous variations
rather than the inheritance of changed habits.
Such variations occasionally occur in animals in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
marked degree. Of a litter of wolf-cubs, all
brought up in the same way, "one became tame
and gentle like a dog, while the others preserved
their natural savagery." Is it not probable that
permanent domestication was rendered possible by
the inevitable selection of spontaneous variations in
this direction? The <i>excessive</i> tameness, too, of the
young rabbit, while easily explicable as a result of
unconscious selection, is not easily explained as a
result of acquired habit. No particular care is
taken to tame or teach or domesticate rabbits.
They are bred for food, or for profit or appearance,
and they are left to themselves most of their
time. As Sir J. Sebright notices with some surprise,
the domestic rabbit "is not often visited,
and seldom handled, and yet it is always tame."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<h3>MODIFICATIONS OBVIOUSLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO
SELECTION.</h3>

<p>Innumerable modifications in accordance with
altered use or disuse, such as the enlarged udders
of cows and goats, and the diminished lungs and
livers in highly bred animals that take little exercise,
can be readily and fully explained as depending
on selection. As the fittest for the natural
or artificial requirements will be favoured, natural
or artificial selection may easily enlarge organs
that are increasingly used and economize in those
that are less needed. I therefore see no necessity
whatever for calling in the aid of use-inheritance
as Darwin does, to account for enlarged udders, or
diminished lungs, or the thick arms and thin legs
of canoe Indians, or the enlarged chests of mountaineers,
or the diminished eyes of moles, or the
lost feet of certain beetles, or the reduced wings of
logger-headed ducks, or the prehensile tails of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
monkeys, or the displaced eyes of soles, or the
altered number of teeth in plaice, or the increased
fertility of domesticated animals, or the shortened
legs and snouts of pigs, or the shortened intestines
of tame rabbits, or the lengthened intestines of
domestic cats, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Changed habits and the requisite
change of structure will usually be favoured
by natural selection; for habit, as Darwin says,
"almost implies that some benefit great or
small is thus derived."</p>

<h3>SIMILAR EFFECTS OF NATURAL SELECTION AND
USE-INHERITANCE.</h3>

<p>Here we perceive a difficulty which will equally
trouble those who affirm use-inheritance and those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
who deny. Broadly speaking, the adaptive effects
ascribed to use-inheritance coincide with the effects
of natural selection. The individual adaptability
(as shown in the thickening of skin, fur, muscle,
&amp;c., under the stimulus of friction, cold, use, &amp;c.)
is identical in kind and direction with the racial
adaptability under natural selection. Consequently
the alleged inheritance of the advantageous effects
of use and disuse cannot readily be distinguished
from the similarly beneficial effects of natural
selection. The indisputable fact that natural
selection imitates or simulates the beneficial
effects ascribed to use-inheritance may be the chief
source and explanation of a belief which may prove
to be thoroughly fallacious. A similar simulation
of course occurs under domestication, where natural
selection is partly replaced by artificial selection
of the best adapted and therefore most flourishing
animals, while in disused parts panmixia or the
comparative cessation of selection will aid or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
replace "economy of growth" in causing diminution.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<h3>INFERIORITY OF SENSES IN EUROPEANS.</h3>

<p>"The inferiority of Europeans, in comparison
with savages, in eyesight and in the other senses,"
is attributed to "the accumulated and transmitted
effect of lessened use during many generations."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
But why may we not attribute it to the slackened
and diverted action of the natural selection which
keeps the senses so keen in some savage races?</p>

<h3>SHORT-SIGHT IN WATCHMAKERS AND
ENGRAVERS.</h3>

<p>Darwin notices that watchmakers and engravers
are liable to be short-sighted, and that short-sight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and long-sight certainly tend to be inherited.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But
we must be careful not to beg the question at issue
by assuming that the frequent heredity of short
sight necessarily covers the heredity of artificially-produced
short-sight. Elsewhere, however, Darwin
states more decisively that "there is ground for
believing that it may often originate in causes
acting on the individual affected, and may thence-forward
become transmissible."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This impression
may arise (1) from the facts of ordinary heredity&mdash;the
ancestral liability being excited in father and
son by similar artificial habits, such as reading, and
viewing objects closely as among watchmakers and
engravers&mdash;or by constitutional deterioration from
indoor life, &amp;c., acting upon a constitutional liability
of the eye to the "something like inflammation
of the coats, under which they yield" and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
cause shortness of sight by altering the spherical
shape of the eye-ball. (2) Panmixia, or the suspension
of natural selection, together with altered
habits, will account for an increase of short-sight
among the population generally. (3) Long-sighted
people could not work at watchmaking
and engraving so comfortably and advantageously
as at other occupations, and hence would be less
likely to take to such callings.</p>

<h3>LARGER HANDS OF LABOURERS' INFANTS.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></h3>

<p>These are best explained as the result of natural
selection and of the diminution of the hand by
sexual selection in the gentry. If the larger hands
of labourers' infants are really due to the inherited
effects of ancestral use, why does the development
occur so early in life, instead of only at a corresponding
period, as is the rule? During the first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
few years of its life, at least, the labourer's infant
does no more work than the gentleman's child.
Why are not the effects of this disuse inherited
by the labourer's infant? If the enlargement of the
infant's hand illustrates the transference of a
character gained later in life, it is evident that the
transference must take place in spite of the inherited
effects of disuse.</p>

<h3>THICKENED SOLE IN INFANTS.</h3>

<p>Darwin also attributes the thickened sole in infants,
"long before birth," to "the inherited effects
of pressure during a long series of generations."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
But disuse should make the infant's sole <i>thin</i>, and
it is this thinness that should be inherited. If we
suppose the inheritance of the thickened soles of
later life to be transferred to an earlier period, we
have the anomaly of the inherited effects of disuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
at that earlier period being overpowered by the
untimely inheritance of the effects of use at another.
On the other hand, it is clear that natural selection
would favour thickened soles for walking on, and
might also promote an early development which
would ensure their being ready in good time for
actual use; for variations in the direction of delay
would be cut off, while variations in the other
direction would be preserved. Anyhow, the mere
transference of a character to an earlier period is
no proof of use-inheritance. The real question is
whether the thickened sole was gained by natural
selection or by the inherited effects of pressure, and
the mere transference or hastened appearance of
the thickening does not in any degree solve this
question. It merely excludes the effect of disuse
during lifetime, and thus presents a fallacious appearance
of being decisive. The thickened sole of
the unborn infant, however, like the lanugo or
hairy covering, is probably a result of the direct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
inheritance of ancestral stages of evolution, of
which the embryo presents a condensed epitome.
While the relative thinness of the infant's sole
might be pointed to as the effect of <i>disuse</i> during a
long series of generations, its thickness is rather an
illustration of atavism still resisting the effects of
long-continued disuse. There is nothing to show
that the inheritable portion of the full original
thickness was not gained by natural selection
rather than by the directly inherited effect of use;
and the latter, being cumulative and indiscriminative
in its action, would apparently have made
the sole very much thicker and harder than it
is. If natural selection were not supreme in such
cases, how could we account for the effects of
pressure resulting in hard hoofs in some cases and
only soft pads in others?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<h3>A SOURCE OF MENTAL CONFUSION.</h3>

<p>Of course in a certain sense this thickening
of the sole has resulted from use. In one sense
or other, most&mdash;or perhaps all&mdash;of the results
of natural selection are inherited effects of use
or disuse. Natural selection preserves that
which is of use and which is used, while it
eliminates that which is useless and is not used.
The most confident assertions of the effects of use
and disuse in modifying the heritable type, appear
to rest on this indefeasible basis. Darwin's statements
concerning the effects of use and disuse in
evolution can frequently be read in two senses.
They often command assent as undeniable truisms
as they stand, but are of course written in another
and more debatable sense. Thus in the case of the
shortened wings and thickened legs of the domestic
duck, I believe equally with Darwin and Spencer
that "no one will dispute that they have resulted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
from the lessened use of the wings and the increased
use of the legs." "Use" is at bottom the
determining circumstance in evolution generally.
The trunk of the elephant, the fin of the fish, the
wing of the bird, the cunning hand of man and his
complicated brain&mdash;and, in short, all organs and
faculties whatsoever&mdash;can only have been moulded
and developed by use&mdash;by usefulness and by using&mdash;but
not necessarily by use-inheritance, not necessarily
by directly inherited effects of use or
disuse of parts in the individual. So, too, reduced
or rudimentary organs are due to disuse, but it by
no means follows that the diminution is caused by
any direct tendency to the inheritance of the effects
of disuse in the individual. The effects of natural
selection are commonly expressible as effects of use
and disuse, just as adaptation in nature is expressible
in the language of teleology. But use-inheritance
is no more proven by one of these necessary
coincidences than special design is by the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
The inevitable simulation of use-inheritance may
be entirely deceptive.</p>

<p>Darwin thinks that "there can be no doubt that
use in our domestic animals has strengthened and
enlarged certain parts, and disuse diminished
them; and that such modifications are inherited."
Undoubtedly "such" or <i>similar</i> modifications have
often been inherited, but how can Darwin possibly
tell that they are not due to the simulation of use-inheritance
by natural or artificial selection acting
upon general variability? Of the inevitability of
selection and of its generally adaptive tendencies
"there can be no doubt," and panmixia would tend
to reduce disused parts; so that there <i>must always</i>
remain grave doubts of the alleged inheritance of
the similar effects of use and disuse, unless we can
accomplish the extremely difficult feat of excluding
both natural and artificial selection as causes
of enlargement, and panmixia and selection as
causes of dwindling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<h3>WEAKNESS OF USE-INHERITANCE.</h3>

<p>Use-inheritance is normally so weak that it
appears to be quite helpless when opposed to any
other factor of evolution. Natural selection evolves
and maintains the instincts of ants and termites
in spite of use-inheritance to a more wonderful
degree than it evolves the instincts of almost any
other animal with the fullest help of use-inheritance.
It develops seldom-used horns or natural
armour just as readily as constantly-used hoofs or
teeth. Sexual selection evolves elaborate structures
like the peacock's tail in spite of disuse and natural
selection combined. Artificial selection appears to
enlarge or diminish used parts or disused parts with
equal facility. The assistance of use-inheritance
seems to be as unnecessary as its opposition is
ineffective.</p>

<p>The alleged inheritance of the effects of use
and disuse in our domestic animals must be very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
slow and slight.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Darwin tells us that "there is
no good evidence that this ever follows in the
course of a single generation." "Several generations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
must be subjected to changed habits for any
appreciable result."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> What does this mean?
One of two things. Either the tendency is
very weak, or it is non-existent. If it is so
weak that we cannot detect its alleged effects
till several generations have elapsed, during which
time the more powerful agency of selection has
been at work, how are we to distinguish the effects
of the minor factor from that of the major? Are
we to conclude that use-inheritance <i>plus</i> selection
will modify races, just as Voltaire firmly held that
incantations, together with sufficient arsenic, would
destroy flocks of sheep? Is it not a significant
fact that the alleged instances of use-inheritance
so often prove to be self-conflicting in their
details?</p>

<p>For satisfactory proof of the prevalence of a
law of use-inheritance we require normal instances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
where selection is clearly inadequate to produce
the change, or where it is scarcely allowed
time or opportunity to act, as in the immediate
offspring of the modified individual. Of the
first kind of cases there seems to be a plentiful
lack. Of the latter kind, according to Darwin,
there appears to be none&mdash;a circumstance which
contrasts strangely and suspiciously with the
many decisive cases in which variation from
unknown causes has been inherited most strikingly
in the immediate offspring. It must be
expected, indeed, that among these innumerable
cases some will accidentally mimic the
alleged effects of use-inheritance.</p>

<p>If Darwin had felt certain that the effects
of habit or use tended in any marked degree
to be conveyed directly and cumulatively to
succeeding generations, he could hardly have
given us such cautious, half-hearted encouragement
of good habits as the following:&mdash;"It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
is not improbable that after long practice virtuous
tendencies may be inherited." "Habits, moreover
followed during many generations probably tend
to be inherited."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> This is probable, independently
of use-inheritance. The "many generations"
specified or implied, will allow time for the
play of selective as well as of cumulatively-educative
influences. There must apparently
be a constitutional or inheritable predisposition
or fitness for the habits spoken of, which otherwise
would scarcely be continued for many
generations, except by the favourably-varying
branches of a family: which again is selection
rather than use-inheritance.</p>

<p>Where is the necessity for even the remains
of the Lamarckian doctrine of inherited habit?
Seeing how powerful the general principle of
selection has shown itself in cases where use-inheritance
could have given no aid or must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
even have offered its most strenuous opposition,
why should it not equally be able to develop used
organs or repress disused organs or faculties
without the assistance of a relatively weak ally?
Selection evolved the remarkable protective
coverings of the armadillo, turtle, crocodile, porcupine,
hedgehog, &amp;c.; it formed alike the rose
and its thorn, the nut and its shell; it developed
the peacock's tail and the deer's antlers, the
protective mimicry of various insects and
butterflies, and the wonderful instincts of the
white ants; it gave the serpent its deadly
poison and the violet its grateful odour; it
painted the gorgeous plumage of the Impeyan
pheasant and the beautiful colours and decorations
of countless birds and insects and flowers.
These, and a thousand other achievements, it
has evidently accomplished without the help of
use-inheritance. Why should it be thought incapable
of reducing a pigeon's wing or enlarging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a duck's leg? Why should it be credited with the
help of an officious ally in effecting comparatively
slight changes, when great and
striking modifications are effected without any
such aid?</p>

it seems strange that Darwin has not noticed any similar shortening

the duck elegant, or "pigeon-breasted"; it has enlarged the abdominal
sack instead, besides allowing the addition of an extra rib in

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> Wallace shows that the changes in our domestic animals, if
spread over the thousands of years since the animals were first
tamed, must be extremely insignificant in each generation, and he
concludes that such infinitesimal effects of use and disuse would be
swallowed up by the far greater effects of variation and selection
(<i>Darwinism</i>, p. 436). Professor Romanes has replied to him in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i> (August 1889), showing that this is no disproof
of the existence of the minor factor, inasmuch as slight changes in
each generation need not necessarily be matters of life and death to
the individual, although their cumulative development by use-inheritance
might eventually become of much service. But selection
would favour spontaneous variations of a similarly serviceable
character. The slightest tendency to eliminate the extreme
variations in either direction would proportionally modify the
average in a breed. Use-inheritance appears to be so relatively
weak a factor that probably neither proof nor disproof of its
existence can ever be given, owing to the practical impossibility of
disentangling its effects (if any) from the effects of admittedly far
more powerful factors which often act in unsuspected ways. Thus
wild ducklings, which can easily be reared by themselves, invariably
"die off" if reared with tame ones (<i>Variation</i>, &amp;c., i. 292, ii. 219).
They cannot get their fair share in the competition for food, and are
completely eliminated. Professor Romanes fully acknowledges
that there is the "gravest possible doubt" as to the transmission of
the effects of disuse (Letter on Panmixia, <i>Nature</i>, March 13, 1890).</p></div>

<h2>INHERITED INJURIES.</h2>

<h3>INHERITED MUTILATIONS.</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> almost universal <i>non-inheritance</i> of mutilations
seems to me a far more valid argument
<i>against</i> a general law of modification-inheritance
than the few doubtful or abnormal cases of
such inheritance can furnish in its favour.
No inherited effect has been produced by the
docking of horses' tails for many generations, or
by a well-known mutilation which has been
practised by the Hebrew race from time immemorial.
As lost or mutilated parts are reproduced
in offspring independently of the existence of
those parts in the parent, there is the less reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to suppose that the particular condition of
parental parts transmits itself, or tends to
transmit itself, to the offspring. So unsatisfactory
is the argument derivable from inherited
mutilations that Mr. Spencer does not mention
them at all, and Darwin has to attribute them
to a special cause which is independent of any
general theory of use-inheritance.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Darwin's most striking case&mdash;and to my mind
the only case of any importance&mdash;is that of Brown-S&eacute;quard's
epileptic guinea-pigs, which inherited the
mutilated condition of parents who had gnawed
off their own gangrenous toes when an&aelig;sthetic
through the sciatic nerve having been divided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
Darwin also mentions a cow that lost a horn by
accident, followed by suppuration, and subsequently
produced three calves which had on the
same side of the head, instead of a horn, a
bony lump attached merely to the skin. Such
cases may seem to prove that mutilation
<i>associated with morbid action</i> is occasionally
inherited or repeated with a promptitude and
thoroughness that contrast most strikingly with
the imperceptible nature of the immediate inheritance
of the effects of use and disuse; but they
by no means prove that mutilation in general
is inheritable, and they are absolutely no proof
whatever of a <i>normal</i> and non-pathological tendency
to the inheritance of acquired characters.
Those who accept Darwin's special explanation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of the supposed inheritance of mutilations, ought
to notice that his explanation applies equally well
under a theory which is strongly adverse to
use-inheritance&mdash;namely, Galton's idea of the
sterilization and complete "using up" of otherwise
reproductive matter in the growth and
maintenance of the personal structure.</p>

<p>Darwin's explanation of inherited mutilations&mdash;which,
as he notes, occur "especially or perhaps
exclusively" when the injury has been followed
by disease<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>&mdash;is that all the representative
gemmules which would develop or repair or
reproduce the injured part are attracted to the
diseased surface during the reparative process
and are there destroyed by the morbid action.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Hence they cannot reproduce the part in offspring.
This explanation by no means implies
that mutilation would <i>usually</i> affect the offspring.
On the contrary, in all ordinary cases of mutilation
the purely atavistic elements or gemmules would
be set free from any modifying influence of the
non-existent or mutilated part. The gemmules&mdash;as
in Galton's theory of heredity and with neuter
insects&mdash;might be perfectly independent of pangenesis
and the normal inheritance of acquired
characters. Such self-multiplying gemmules without
pangenesis would enable us to understand
both the excessive weakness or non-existence of
normal use-inheritance, and the excessive strength
and abruptness of the effect of their partial destruction
under special pathological conditions.</p>

<p>The series of epileptic phenomena that can be
excited by tickling a certain part of the cheek
and neck of the adult guinea-pig during the growth
and rejoining of the ends of the severed nerve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
are said to be repeated with striking accuracy of
detail in the young who inherit mutilated toes;
but as epilepsy is often due to some <i>one</i> exciting
cause or morbid condition, the single transmission
of a highly morbid condition of the system might
easily reproduce the whole chain of consequences
and might also have caused the loss of toes.</p>

<p>The particulars of the guinea-pig cases are
very inadequately recorded,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> but the results are so
anomalous<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> that Brown-S&eacute;quard's own conclusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
is that the epilepsy and the inherited injuries are
<i>not</i> directly transmitted, but that "what is
transmitted is the morbid state of the nervous
system." He thinks that the missing toes may
"possibly" be exceptions to this conclusion,
"but the other facts only imply the transmission
of a morbid state of the sympathetic or sciatic
nerve or of a part of the medulla oblongata."
Until we can tell what is transmitted, we are not
in a position to determine whether there is any
true inheritance or only an exaggerated simulation
of it under peculiar circumstances. When the
actual observers believe that the mutilations and
epilepsy are not the cause of their own repetition,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and when these observers guard themselves by
such phrases as, "if any conclusion can at present
be drawn from those facts," we who have only
incomplete reports to guide us may well be
excused if we preserve an even more pronounced
attitude of caution and reserve.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The morbid state
of the system may be wholly due to general injury
of the germs rather than to specific inheritance.</p>

<p>Weismann suggests that the morbid condition
of the nervous system may be due to some
infection such as might arise from microbes, which
find a home in the mutilated and disordered
nervous system in the parent, and subsequently
transmit themselves to the offspring through the
reproductive elements, as the infections of various
diseases appear to do&mdash;the muscardine silkworm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
disease in particular being known to be conveyed
to offspring in this manner.</p>

<p>But whether we can discover the true explanation
or not, inherited mutilations can hardly
be accounted for as the result of a general
tendency to inherit acquired modifications.
How could a factor which seems to be totally
inoperative in cases of ordinary mutilation, and
only infinitesimally operative in transmitting the
normal effects of use and disuse, suddenly become
so powerful as to completely overthrow atavism,
and its own tendency to transmit the non-mutilated
type of one of the parents and of
the non-mutilated type presented by the injured
parent in earlier life? Does not so striking and
abrupt an intensification of its usually insignificant
power demand an explanation widely different
from that which might account for the extremely
slow and slight inheritance of the normal effects
of use and disuse? Surely it would be better to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
suspend one's judgment as to the true explanation
of highly exceptional and purely pathological cases
rather than resort to an hypothesis that creates more
difficulties than it solves.</p>

<h3>THE MOTMOT'S TAIL.</h3>

<p>The narrowing of the long central tail
feathers of the motmot is attributed to the inherited
effects of habitual mutilation (<i>Descent of
Man</i>, pp. 384, 603). But in the specimens at South
Kensington<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> the narrowness extends upwards
much beyond the habitually denuded part, and the
broadened end is the broadest part of the whole
feather. If the inherited effect of an inch or
two of denudation extends from three to six inches
upwards, why has it not also extended two inches
downwards so as to narrow the broadened end?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
The narrowness seems to be a mainly relative or
negative effect produced by the broadening out
of a long tapering feather at its end under the
influence of sexual selection. Several other birds
have similarly narrowed or spoon-shaped feathers
and do not bite them. Is it not more feasible to
suppose that this attractive peculiarity first suggested
its artificial intensification, than to suppose
that the bird began nibbling without any definite
cause? Sexual selection would then encourage
the habit. Anyhow, it is as impossible to show
that the mutilation preceded the narrowing as it
is to show that tonsure preceded baldness.</p>

<h3>OTHER INHERITED INJURIES MENTIONED BY
DARWIN.</h3>

<p>Darwin quotes some cases from Dr. Prosper
Lucas's "long" but weak and unsatisfactory "list<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of inherited injuries."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> But Lucas was somewhat
credulous. One of his cases is that many girls
were born in London without mamm&aelig; through the
injurious effect of certain corsets on the mothers.
He also gives a long account of a Jew who could
read through the thick covers of a book, and whose
son inherited this "hyper&aelig;sthesia" of the sense
of sight in a still more remarkable degree (i.
113-119). Evidently Lucas's cases cannot be
accepted without some amount of reserve.</p>

<p>The cases of the three calves which inherited
the one-horned condition of the cow, the two sons
who inherited a father's crooked finger, and the two
sons who were microphthalmic on the same side
as their father had lost an eye, may be due to
mere coincidence; or an inherited constitutional
tendency or liability might lead to somewhat similar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
results in parent and offspring<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>&mdash;just as the tendency
to certain fatal diseases or to suicide may
produce similar results in father and son, although
the artificially-produced hanging or apoplexy obviously
cannot be directly transmitted. That more
than one of the offspring was affected does not
render the chances against coincidence "almost infinitely
great," as Darwin mistakenly supposes. It
"frequently occurs" that a man's sons or daughters
may <i>all</i> exhibit either a latent or a newly-developed
congenital peculiarity previously unknown;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and
the coincidence may merely be that one of the
parents accidentally suffered a similar kind of injury&mdash;a
kind of coincidence which must of course
occasionally occur, and which may have been
partly caused by a latent tendency. The chances<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
against coincidence are indeed great, but the cases
appear to be correspondingly rare.</p>

<p>Darwin acknowledges that many supposed
instances of inherited mutilation may be due
to coincidence; and there is apparently no more
reason for attributing inherited scars, &amp;c., to
any special form of heredity than to the effect of
the mother's imagination on the unborn babe&mdash;a
popular but fallacious belief in corroboration of
which far more alleged instances could be collected
than of the inheritance of injuries.</p>

<p>As an instance of the coincidences that occur,
I may mention that a friend of mine has a
daughter who was born with a small hole in one
ear, just as if it were already pierced for the earring
which she has since worn in it. I suppose,
however, that no one will venture to claim
this as an instance of the inheritance of a
mutilation practised by female ancestors, especially
as such holes are not altogether unknown or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
inexplicable, though very rarely occurring low
down in the lobe of the ear.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Many cases are known of the inheritance of
mutilations or malformations arising congenitally
from some abrupt variation in the reproductive
elements. In such cases as the one-eared rabbits,
the two-legged pigs, the three-legged dogs, the
one-horned stags, hornless bulls, earless rabbits,
lop-eared rabbits, tailless dogs, &amp;c., if the
father or the mother or the embryo had suffered
from some accident or disease which might plausibly
have been assigned as the cause of the
original malformation, these transmitted defects
would readily be cited as instances of the
inheritance of an accidentally-produced modification.</p>

<p>The inheritance of exostoses on horses' legs may
be the inheritance of a constitutional tendency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
rather than of the effect of the parents' hard
travelling. Horses congenitally liable to such
formations would transmit the liability,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and
this might readily be mistaken for inheritance of
the results of the liability. An apparent increase
in this liability might arise from greater attention
being now paid to it, or from increased use of
harder roads; or a real increase might be due to
panmixia and some obscure forms of correlation.</p>

<h3>QUASI-INHERITANCE.</h3>

<p>Of course artificially-caused ill-health or weakness
in parents will tend in a general way to
injure the offspring. But deterioration thus
caused is only a form of quasi-inheritance, as I
should prefer to call it. Semi-starvation in a new-born
babe is <i>not</i> truly inherited from its half-starved
mother, but is the direct result of insufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
nourishment. The general welfare of germs&mdash;as of
parasites&mdash;is necessarily bound up with that of
the organism which feeds and shelters them, but
this is not heredity, and is quite irrelevant to the
question whether particular modifications are
transmitted or not.</p>

<p>Another form of quasi-inheritance is seen in the
communication of certain infections to offspring.
Not being transmitted by the action of the organism
so much as in defiance of it, such diseases
are not truly hereditary, though for convenience'
sake they are usually so described.</p>

<p>A perversion or prevention of true inheritance
is also seen in the action of alcohol, or excessive
overwork, or any other cause which by originating
morbid conditions in individuals may also injure
the reproductive elements.</p>

<p>These forms of quasi-inheritance are, of course,
highly important so far as the improvement of
the race is concerned. So, too, is the fact that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
improved or deteriorated habits and thoughts are
transmitted by personal teaching and influence and
are cumulative in their effect. But all this must
not be confounded with the inheritance of acquired
characters. Cases of quasi-inheritance
may perhaps be most readily distinguished from
cases of true inheritance by the time test. When
a modification acquired in adult life is promptly
communicated to the child in early life or from
birth, it may rightly be suspected that the inheritance,
like that of money or title, is not truly
congenital, but is extraneous or even anti-congenital
in its nature. Judged by such a standard,
the inherited injuries in Brown-S&eacute;quard's
guinea-pigs are only exceptional cases of quasi-inheritance,
and are not necessarily indicative
of any general rule affecting true inheritance.</p>

Lost toes were only seen by Dr. Dupuy in three young out
of two hundred. Obersteiner found that most of the offspring of
his epileptic guinea-pigs were injuriously affected, being weakly,
small, paralysed in one or more limbs, and so forth. Only two
were epileptic, and both were weakly and died early (Weismann's
<i>Essays</i>, p. 311). A morbid condition of the spinal cord might affect
the hind limbs especially (as in paraplegia) and might occasionally
cause loss of toes in the embryo by preventing development or by
ulceration. Brown-S&eacute;quard does not say that the defective feet
were on the same side as in the parents (<i>Lancet</i>, Jan., 1875, pp. 7, 8).</p></div>

the body as in the parent, and where parents had lost <i>all</i> the toes
of a foot, or the whole foot, the few offspring affected usually had
lost only two toes out of the three, or only a part of one or two
or three toes. Sometimes the offspring had toes missing on <i>both</i>
hind feet, although the parent was only affected in <i>one</i>. <i>One</i> diseased
ear and eye in the parent was "generally" or "always" succeeded
by <i>two</i> equally affected ears and eyes in the offspring (cf. <i>Pop.
Science Monthly</i>, New York, xi. 334). The important law of
inheritance at corresponding periods was also set aside. Gangrene
or inflammation commenced in both ears and both eyes soon after
birth (pointing possibly to infection of some kind); the epileptic
period commenced "perhaps two months or more after birth," while
the loss of toes had occurred before birth. In no case, as Weismann
points out, is the original mutilation of the nervous system ever transmitted.
Even where an extirpated ganglion was never regenerated
in the parent, the offspring always regained the part in an apparently
perfect condition. On the whole the conflicting results ought to be
as puzzling to those who may attribute them to a universal tendency
to inherit the exact condition of parents as they are to those who, like
myself, are sceptical as to the existence of such a law or tendency.</p></div>

<h2>MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS.</h2>

<h3>TRUE RELATION OF PARENTS AND OFFSPRING.</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">It</span> is difficult to entirely free ourselves from
the flattering and almost universal idea that parents
are true originators or creators of copies of
themselves. But the main truth, if not the whole
truth, is that they are merely the transmitters
of types of which they and their offspring are
alike more or less similarly moulded resultants.
A parent is a trustee. He transmits, not himself
and his own modifications, but the stock, the
type, the representative elements, of which he is
a product and a custodian in one. It seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
probable that he has no more definite or
"particulate" influence over the reproductive
elements within him than a mother over the
embryo or a vessel over its cargo. Parent and
offspring are like successive copies of books
printed from the same "type." A battered
letter in the "type" will display its effects in
both earlier and later copies alike, but a purely
extraneous or acquired flaw in the first copy is
not necessarily repeated in subsequent copies. Unlike
printer's type, however, the material source
of heredity is of a fluctuating nature, consisting
of competing elements derived from two parents
and from innumerable ancestors.</p>

<p>Galton compares parent and child to successive
pendants on the same chain. Weismann
likens them to successive offshoots thrown up by
a long underground root or sucker. Such comparisons
indicate the improbability of acquired
modifications being transmitted to offspring.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>That parts are developed in offspring independently
of those parts in parents is clear.
Mutilated parents transmit parts which they do
not possess. The offspring of young parents cannot
inherit the later stages of life from parents who
have not passed through them. Cases of remote
reversion or atavism show that ancestral peculiarities
can transmit themselves in a latent or
undeveloped condition for hundreds or thousands
of generations. Many obvious facts compelled
Darwin to suppose that vast numbers of the reproductive
gemmules in an individual are not thrown
off by his own cells, but are the self-multiplying
progeny of ancestral gemmules. Galton restricts
the production of gemmules by the personal
structure to a few exceptional cases, and would
evidently like to dispense with pangenesis altogether,
if he could only be sure that acquired
characters are never inherited. Weismann entirely
rejects pangenesis and the inheritance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
acquired characters. This enables him to explain
heredity by his theory of the "Continuity
of the Germ-plasm."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Parent and offspring are
alike successive products or offshoots of this
persistent germ-substance, which obviously would
not be correspondingly affected by modifications of
parts in parents, and so would render the transmission
of acquired characters impossible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<h3>INVERSE INHERITANCE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Galton contends that the reproductive elements
become sterile when used in forming and
maintaining the individual, and that only a small
proportion of them are so used.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He holds that
the next generation will be formed entirely, or
almost entirely, from the residue of undeveloped
germs, which, not having been employed in the
structure and work of the individual, have been
free to multiply and form the reproductive elements
whence future individuals are derived. Hence the
singular inferiority not infrequently displayed by
the children of men of extraordinary genius,
especially where the ancestry has been only of a
mediocre ability. The valuable germs have been
used up in the individual, and rendered sterile in
the structure of his person. Hence, too, the "strong
tendency to deterioration in the transmission of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
every exceptionally gifted race." Mr. Galton's
hypothesis "explains the fact of certain diseases
skipping one or more generations," and it "agrees
singularly well with many classes of fact;" and it
is strongly opposed to the theory of use-inheritance.
The elements which are used die almost universally
without germ progeny: the germs which are <i>not</i>
used are the great source of posterity. Hence,
when the germs or gemmules which achieve development
are either better or worse than the
residue, the qualities transmitted to offspring will
be of an inverse character. If brain-work attracts,
develops <i>and sterilizes</i> the best gemmules, the
ultimate effect of education on the intellect of
posterity may differ from its immediate effect.</p>

<h3>EARLY ORIGIN OF THE OVA.</h3>

<p>As the ova are formed at as early a period
as the rest of the maternal structure, Galton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
notices that it seems improbable that they
would be correspondingly affected by subsequent
modifications of parental structure. Of
course it is not certain that this is a valid
argument. We know that the paternal half of
the reproductive elements does not enter the
ovum till a comparatively late stage in its history,
and it is quite possible that maternal elements or
gemmules may also enter the ovum from without.
If reproductive elements were confined to one
special part or organ, we should be unable to explain
the reproduction of lost limbs in salamanders,
and the persistent effect of intercrossing on subsequent
issue by the same mother, and the propagation
of plants from shoots, or of the begonia from
minute fragments of leaves, or the development of
small pieces of water-worms into complete animals.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<h3>MARKED EFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE ON THE
INDIVIDUAL.</h3>

<p>These are, to some extent, an argument against
the cumulative inheritance of such effects. When
a nerve atrophies from disuse, or a duct shrivels,
or bone is absorbed, or a muscle becomes small or
flabby, it proves, so far, that the average effect of
use through enormous ages is <i>not</i> transmitted.
When the fibula of a dog's leg thickens by 400 per
cent. to a size "equal to or greater than" that of
the removed tibia which previously did the work,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
it shows that in spite of disuse for countless generations,
the "almost filiform" bone has retained a
potentiality of development which is fully equal to
that possessed by the larger one which has been
constantly used. When, after being reared on the
ailanthus, the caterpillars of the <i>Bombyx hesperus</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
die of hunger rather than return to their natural
food, the inherited effect of ancestral habit does
not seem to be particularly strong. Neither is
there any strongly-inherited effect of long-continued
ancestral wildness in many animals which
are easily tamed.</p>

<h3>WOULD NATURAL SELECTION FAVOUR USE-INHERITANCE?</h3>

<p>If use-inheritance is really one of the factors of
evolution, it is certainly a subordinate one, and an
utterly helpless one, whenever it comes into conflict
with the great ruling principle of Selection.
Would this dominant cause of evolution have
favoured a tendency to use-inheritance if such
had appeared, or would it have discouraged
and destroyed it? We have already seen that
use-inheritance is unnecessary, since natural selection
will be far more effective in bringing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
about advantageous modifications; and if it can
be shown that use-inheritance would often be
an evil, it then becomes probable that on the
whole natural selection would more strongly discourage
and eliminate it as a hostile factor than
it might occasionally favour such a tendency as a
totally unnecessary aid.</p>

<h3>USE-INHERITANCE AN EVIL.</h3>

<p>Use-inheritance would crudely and indiscriminately
proportion parts to actual work done&mdash;or
rather to the varying <i>nourishment and growth</i>
resulting from a multiplicity of causes&mdash;and this
in its various details would often conflict most
seriously with the real necessities of the case,
such as occasional passive strength, or appropriate
shape, lightness and general adaptation. If its
accumulated effects were not corrected by natural
or sexual selection, horns and antlers would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
disappear in favour of enlarged hoofs. The
elephant's tusks would become smaller than its
teeth. Men would have callosities for sitting
on, like certain monkeys, and huge corns or
hoofs for walking on. Bones would often be
modified disastrously. Thus the condyle of the
human jaw would become larger than the body
of the jaw, because as the fulcrum of the lever
it receives more pressure. Some organs (like the
heart, which is always at work) would become
inconveniently or unnecessarily large. Other
absolutely indispensable organs, which are comparatively
passive or are very seldom used,
would dwindle until their weakness caused the
ruin of the individual or the extinction of the
species. In eliminating various evil results of use-inheritance,
natural selection would be eliminating
use-inheritance itself. The displacement of
Lamarck's theory by Darwin's shows that the
effects of use-inheritance often differ from those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
required by natural selection; and it is clear that
the latter factor must at least have reduced use-inheritance
to the very minor position of comparative
feebleness and harmlessness assigned to it
by Darwin.</p>

<p>Use-inheritance would be ruinous through
causing unequal variation in co-operative parts&mdash;of
which Mr. Spencer may accept his own instances
of the jaws and teeth, and the cave-crab's
lost eyes and persistent eye-stalks, as typical
examples. That the variation would be unequal
seems almost self-evident from the varying rapidity
and extent of the effects of use and disuse on
different tissues and on different parts of the
general structure. The optic nerve may atrophy in
a few months from disuse consequent on the loss
of the eye. Some of the bones of the rudimentary
hind legs of the whale are still in existence after
disuse for an enormous period. Evidently use-inheritance
could not equally modify the turtle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
and its shell, or the brain and its skull; and in
minor matters there would be the same incongruity
of effect. Thus, if the molar teeth lengthened
from extra use the incisors could not meet. Unequal
and indiscriminate variation would throw
the machinery of the organism out of gear in
innumerable ways.</p>

<p>Use-inheritance would perpetuate various evils.
We are taught, for instance, that it perpetuates
short-sight, inferior senses, epilepsy, insanity,
nervous disorders, and so forth. It would apparently
transmit the evil effects of over-exertion,
disuse, hardship, exposure, disease and accident,
as well as the defects of age or immaturity.</p>

<p>Would it not be better on the whole if each
individual took a fresh start as far as possible
on the advantageous typical lines laid down by
natural selection? Through the long stages of
evolution from prim&aelig;val protoplasm upwards,
such species as were least affected by use-inheritance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
would be most free to develop necessary but
seldom-used organs, protective coverings such as
shells or skulls, and natural weapons, defences,
ornaments, special adaptations, and so forth; and
this would be an advantage&mdash;for survival would
obviously depend on the <i>importance</i> of a structure
or faculty in deciding the struggle for existence
and reproduction, and not on the total amount
of its using or nourishment. If natural selection
had on the whole favoured this officious ally and
frequent enemy, surely we should find better evidence
of its existence.</p>

<p>Without laying undue stress upon the evil
effects of use-inheritance, a careful examination
of them in detail may at least serve to counter-balance
the optimistic <i>a priori</i> arguments for
belief in that plausible but unproven factor of
evolution.</p>

<p>The benefits derivable from use-inheritance are
largely illusory. The effects of <i>use</i>, indeed, are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
generally beneficial up to a certain point; for
natural selection has sanctioned or evolved organs
which possess the property or potentiality of developing
to the right extent under the stimulus
of use or nourishment. But use-<i>inheritance</i> would
cumulatively alter this individual adaptability,
and would tend to fix the size of organs by the
average amount of ancestral use or disuse rather
than by the actual requirements of the individual.
Of course under changed conditions involving
increased or lessened use of parts it might
become advantageous; but even here it may
prove a decided hindrance to adaptive evolution in
some respects as well as an unnecessary aid in
others. Thus in the case of animals becoming
heavier, or walking more, it would <i>lengthen</i> the
legs although natural selection might require them
to be shortened. In the Aylesbury duck and the
Call duck, if use-inheritance has increased the
dimensions of the bones and tendons of the leg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
natural selection has had to counteract this increase
so far as length is concerned, and to effect 8 per
cent. of shortening besides. If use-inheritance
thickens bones without proportionally lengthening
them, it would hinder rather than help the evolution
of such structures as the long light wings of birds,
or the long legs and neck of the giraffe or crane.</p>

<h3>VARIED EFFECTS OF USE AND DISUSE.</h3>

<p>The changes which we somewhat roughly
and empirically group together as the effects of
"use and disuse" are of widely diverse character.
Thus bone, as the physiological fact, thickens under
<i>alternations</i> of pressure (and the consequent
increased flow of nourishment), but atrophies
under a steadily continued pressure; so that if
the use of a bone involved continuous pressure,
the effect of such use would be a partial or total
absorption of that bone. Darwin shows that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
bone lengthens as well as thickens from carrying
a greater weight, while tension (as seen in
sailors' arms, which are used in pulling) appears to
have an equally marked effect in shortening bones
(<i>Descent of Man</i>, p. 32). Thus different kinds of
use may produce opposite results. The cumulative
inheritance of such effects would often be
mischievous. The limbs of the sloth and the
prehensile tail of the spider monkey would
continually grow shorter, while the legs of the
evolving elephant or rhinoceros might lengthen
to an undesirable extent. Such cumulative
tendencies of use-inheritance, if they exist, are
obviously well kept under by natural selection.</p>

<p>Although the ultimate effect of use is generally
growth or enlargement through increased flow of
blood, the first effect usually is a loss of substance,
and a consequent diminution of size and strength.
When the loss exceeds the growth, use will
diminish or deteriorate the part used, while disuse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
would enlarge or perfect it. Teeth, claws, nails,
skin, hair, hoofs, feathers, &amp;c., may thus be worn
away faster than they can renew themselves.
But this wearing away usually stimulates the
repairing process, and so increases the rate of
growth; that is, it will increase the size produced,
if not the size retained. Which effect of use does
use-inheritance transmit in such cases&mdash;the increased
rate of growth, or the dilapidation of the
worn-out parts? We can hardly suppose that
both these effects of use will be inherited. Would
shaving destroy the beard in time or strengthen
it? Will the continued shearing of sheep
increase or lessen the growth of wool? What
will be the ultimate effect of plucking geese's
quills, and of the eider duck's abstraction of the
down from her breast? If the mutilated parts
grow stronger or more abundantly, why were
the motmot's feathers alleged to be narrowed by
the inherited effects of ancestral nibbling?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The "use" or "work" or "function" of muscles,
nerves, bones, teeth, skin, tendon, glands, ducts,
eyes, blood corpuscles, cilia, and the other constituents
of the organism, is as widely different as
the various parts are from each other, and the
effects of their use or disuse are equally varied
and complicated.</p>

<h3>USE-INHERITANCE IMPLIES PANGENESIS.</h3>

<p>How could the transmission of these varied
effects to offspring be accounted for? Is it possible
to believe, with Mr. Spencer, that the effects
of use and disuse on the parts of the personal
structure are simultaneously registered in corresponding
impressions on the seminal germs?
Must we not feel, with Darwin apparently,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> that
the <i>only</i> intelligible explanation of use-inheritance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
is the hypothesis of Pangenesis, according to
which each modified cell, or physiological unit,
throws off similarly-modified gemmules or parts
of itself, which ultimately reproduce the change
in offspring? If we reject pangenesis, it becomes
difficult to see how use-inheritance can be
possible.</p>

<h3>PANGENESIS IMPROBABLE.</h3>

<p>The more important and best-known phenomena
of heredity do not require any such
hypothesis, and leading facts (such as atavism,
transmission of lost parts, and the general non-transmission
of acquired characters) are so adverse
to it that Darwin has to concede that many of the
reproductive gemmules are atavistic, and that by
continuous self-multiplication they may preserve
a practical "continuity of germ-substance," as
Weismann would term it. The idea that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
relationship of offspring to parent is one of direct
descent is, as Galton tells us, "wholly untenable";
and the only reason he admits some supplementary
traces of pangenesis into his "Theory of
Heredity,"<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> is that he may thus account for the
more or less questionable cases of the transmission
of acquired characters. But there appears
to be no necessity even for this concession. We
ought therefore to dispense with the useless and
gratuitous hypothesis that cells multiply by
throwing off minute self-multiplying gemmules, as
well as by the well-known method of self-division.
If pangenesis occurs, the transmission of acquired
characters ought to be a prominent fact.
The size, strength, health and other good or evil
qualities of the cells could hardly fail to exercise
a marked and corresponding effect upon the size
and quality of the reproductive gemmules thrown
off by those cells. The direct evidence tends to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
show that these free gemmules do not exist. Transfusion
of blood has failed to affect inheritance in
the slightest degree. Pangenesis, with its attraction
of gemmules from all parts of the body into the
germ-cells, and the free circulation of gemmules
in the offspring till they hit upon or are attracted
by the particular cell or cells, with which alone
they can readily unite, seems a less feasible theory
and less in conformity with the whole of the facts
than an hypothesis of germ-continuity which supposes
that the development of the germ-plasm
and of the successive self-dividing cells of the
body proceeds from within. Darwin's keen
analogy of the fertilization of plants by pollen
renders development from without conceivable,
but as there are no insects to convey gemmules to
their destination, each kind of gemmule would
have to be exceedingly numerous and easily attracted
from amongst an inconceivable number of
other gemmules. Arguments against pangenesis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
can also be drawn from the case of neuter insects&mdash;a
fact which seems to have escaped Darwin's
notice, although he had seen how strongly that
case was opposed to the doctrine which is the
essential basis of the theory of pangenesis.</p>

<h3>SPENCER'S EXPLANATION OF USE-INHERITANCE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Spencer's explanation of the inheritance of
the effects of use and disuse (p. 36) is that "while
generating a modified <i>consensus</i> of functions and of
structures, the activities are at the same time impressing
this modified <i>consensus</i> on the sperm-cells
and germ-cells whence future individuals are to be
produced"&mdash;a proposition which reads more like
metaphysics than science. Difficult to understand
or believe in ordinary instances, such <i>consensus</i>-inheritance
seems impossible in cases like that of
the hive-bee. Can we suppose that the <i>consensus</i>
of the activities of the working bee impresses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
itself on the sperm-cells of the drones and on the
germ-cells of the carefully secluded queen?
B&uuml;chner thinks so, for he says: "Although the
queens and drones do not now work, yet the
capacities inherited from earlier times still remain to
them, especially to the former, and are kept alive
and fresh by the impressions constantly made upon
them during life, and they are thus in a position to
transmit them to posterity." Surely it is better
to abandon a cherished theory than to be compelled
to defend it by explanations which are as
inconsistent as they are inadequate. New capacities
are developed as well as old ones kept fresh.
The massacre or expulsion of the drones would
have to impress itself on the germ-cells of an onlooking
queen, and the imprisonment of the
queen on the sperm-cells of the drones&mdash;and in
such a way, moreover, as to be afterwards developed
into action in the neuters only. And
use-inheritance all the while is being thoroughly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
overpowered by impression-inheritance&mdash;by the
full transmission of that which is merely seen in
others! If such a law prevails, one may feel
cold because an ancestor thought of the frosty
Caucasus. None of this absurdity would arise if
it were clearly seen that a parent is only a trustee&mdash;that
transmission and development are perfectly
distinct&mdash;that parental modifications are irrelevant
to those transmitted to offspring.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS.</h2>

<h3>USE-INHERITANCE DISCREDITED AS UNNECESSARY,
UNPROVEN, AND IMPROBABLE.</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">General</span> experience teaches that acquired
characters are not usually inherited; and investigation
shows that the apparent exceptions to
this great rule are probably fallacious. Even the
alleged instances of use-inheritance culled by such
great and judicious selectors as Darwin and
Spencer break down upon examination; for they
can be better explained without use-inheritance
than with it. On the other hand, the adverse
facts and considerations are almost strong enough
to prove the actual non-existence of such a law or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
tendency. There is no need to undertake the
apparently impossible task of demonstrating an
absolute negative. It will be enough to ask that
the Lamarckian factor of use-inheritance shall be
removed from the category of accredited factors of
evolution to that of unnecessary and improbable
hypotheses. The main explanation or source of
the fallacy may be found in the fact that natural
selection frequently imitates some of the more
obvious effects of use and disuse.</p>

<h3>MODERN RELIANCE ON USE-INHERITANCE
MISPLACED.</h3>

<p>Modern philanthropy&mdash;so far at least as it ever
studies ultimate results&mdash;constantly relies on this
ill-founded belief as its justification for ignoring
the warnings of those who point out the ultimately
disastrous results of a systematic defiance
or reversal of the great law of natural selection.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
This reliance finds strong support in Mr. Spencer's
latest teachings, for he holds that the inheritance
of the effects of use and disuse takes place
universally, and that it is now "the chief factor"
in the evolution of civilized man (pp. 35, 74, iv)&mdash;natural
selection being quite inadequate for the
work of progressive modification. Practically he
abandons the hope of evolution by natural selection,
and substitutes the ideal of a nation being
"modified <i>en masse</i> by transmission of the effects"
of its institutions and habits. Use-inheritance
will "mould its members far more rapidly and
comprehensively" than can be effected by the
survival of the fittest alone.</p>

<p>But could we rely upon the aid of use-inheritance
if it really were a universal law and not
a mere simulation of one? Let us consider some
of the features of this alleged factor of evolution,
seeing that it is henceforth to be our principal
means of securing the improvement of our species<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and our continued adaptation to the changing
conditions of a progressive civilization.</p>

<p>It is curiously uncertain and irregular in its
action. It diminishes or abolishes some structures
(such as jaws or eyes) without correspondingly
diminishing or abolishing other equally disused
and closely related parts (such as teeth, or eye-stalks).
It thickens ducks' leg-bones while allowing
them to shorten. It shortens the disused
wing-bones of ducks and the leg-bones of rabbits
while allowing them to thicken; and yet in other
cases it greatly reduces the thickness of bones
without shortening them. It transmits tameness
most powerfully in an animal which usually
cannot acquire it. It aids in webbing the feet of
water-dogs, but fails to web the feet of the water-hen
or to remove the web in the feet of upland
geese.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It allows the disused fibula to retain a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
potentiality of development fully equal to that
possessed by the long-used tibia. It lengthens
legs because they are used in supporting the
body, and shortens arms because they are used
in pulling. Whether it enlarges brain if used
in one way and diminishes it if used in another,
we cannot tell; but it must obviously deaden
nervous sensibilities in some cases and intensify
them in others. It enlarges hands long
before they are used, and thickens soles long
before the time for walking on them. At the
same time, as if by an oversight, it so delays its
transmission of the habit of walking on these
thickened soles, that the gradual and tedious acquisition
of the non-transmitted habit costs the
infant much time and trouble and often some pain
and danger. Yet where aided by natural selection,
as with chickens and foals, it transmits the habit
in wonderful perfection and at a remarkably
early date. It transmits new paces in horses in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a single generation, but fails to perpetuate the
songs of birds. It modifies offspring like parents,
and yet allows the formation of two reproductive
types in plants, and of two or more types widely
different from the parents in some of the higher
insects. It is said to be indispensable for the co-ordinated
development of man and the giraffe
and the elk, but appears to be unnecessary for the
evolution and the maintenance of wonderful
structures and habits and instincts in a thousand
species of ants and bees and termites. It is the
only possible means of complex evolution and
adaptation of co-operative parts, and yet in
Mr. Spencer's most representative case it renders
such important parts as teeth and jaws unsuited
for each other, and is said to ruin the teeth by the
consequent overcrowding and decay. It survives
amidst a general "lack of recognised evidence,"
and only seems to act usefully and healthily and
regularly in quarters where it can least easily be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
distinguished from other more powerful and demonstrable
factors of evolution. So little does it
care to display its powers where they would be
easily verifiable as well as useful that practical
breeders ignore it. So slight is its independent
power that it seems to allow natural selection or
sexual selection or artificial selection to modify
organisms in sheer defiance of its utmost opposition,
just as readily as they modify organisms in
other directions with its utmost help. If it
partially perpetuates and extends the pecked-out
indentations in the motmot's tail feathers, it on the
other hand fails to transmit the slightest trace of
mutilation in an almost infinite number of
ordinary cases, and even where the mutilation is
repeated for a hundred generations; and it
apparently repairs rather than transmits the
ordinary and oft-repeated losses caused by
plucking hair, down and feathers, and the wear
and tear of claws, teeth, hoofs and skin.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<p>It is often mischievous as well as anomalous in
its action. Under civilization with its division of
labour, the various functions of mind and body are
very unequally exercised. There is overwork or
misuse of one part and disuse and neglect of others,
leading to the partial breakdown or degeneration
of various organs and to general deterioration of
health through disturbed balance of the constitution.
The brain, or rather particular parts of it, are
often over-stimulated, while the body is neglected.
In many ways education and civilization foster
nervousness and weakness, and undermine the rude
natural health and spirits of the human animal.
Alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee, extra brain work, late
hours, dissipation, overwork, indoor life, division of
labour, preservation of the weak, and many other
causes, all help to injure the modern constitution;
so that the prospect of cumulative intensification of
these evils by the additional influence of use-inheritance
is not an encouraging one. It is true<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that modern progress and prosperity are improving
the people in various respects by their direct action;
but if use-inheritance has any share in effecting this
improvement it must also transmit increased wants
and more luxurious habits, together with such evils
as have already been referred to. As depicted by
its defenders, use-inheritance transmits evils far
more powerfully and promptly than benefits. It
transmits insanity and shattered nerves rather than
the healthy brain which preceded the breakdown.
It perpetuates, and cumulatively intensifies, a
deterioration in the senses of civilized men, but it
fails to perpetuate the rank vigour of various plants
when too well nourished, or the flourishing condition
of various animals when too fat or when tamed. It
already transmits the short-sight caused by so
modern an art as watchmaking, but so fails to
transmit the long-practised art of seeing (as it does
of walking and talking) that vision is worse than
useless to a man until he gradually acquires the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
necessary but non-transmitted associations of
sensation and idea by his own experience. In a
well-known case, a blind man on gaining his sight
by an operation said that "all objects seemed
to touch his eyes, as what he felt did his skin"&mdash;so
little had the universal experience of countless ages
impressed itself on his faculties. Under normal
healthy conditions use-inheritance is so slow in
its action that "several generations" must elapse
before it produces any appreciable effect, and then
that effect is only precisely what selection might be
expected to bring about without its aid. Strong
for evil and slow for good, it can convey epilepsy
promptly in guinea pigs, but transmits the acquirements
of genius so poorly that our best student
of the heredity of genius has to account for the
frequent and remarkable deterioration of the
offspring by a theory which is strongly hostile to
use-inheritance. It would tend to make organisms
unworkable by the excessive differences in its rate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and manner of action on co-operative parts, and
by adapting these parts to the total amount of
nourishment received rather than to occasional
necessity or actual usefulness. It would tend to
stereotype habits and convert reason into instinct.</p>

<p>How then can we rely upon use-inheritance for
the improvement of the race? Even if it is not a
sheer delusion, it may be more detrimental as a positive
evil than it is advantageous as an unnecessary
benefit; and as a normal modifying agent it is
miserably weak and untrustworthy in comparison
with the powerful selective influences by which
nature and society continually and inevitably affect
the species for good or for evil. The effects of use
and disuse&mdash;rightly directed by education in its
widest sense&mdash;must of course be called in to secure
the highly essential but nevertheless <i>superficial,
limited, and partly deceptive</i> improvement of individuals
and of social manners and methods; but as
this artificial development of already existing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
potentialities does not directly or readily tend to
become congenital, it is evident that some considerable
amount of natural or artificial selection of the
more favourably varying individuals will still be the
only means of securing the race against the constant
tendency to degeneration which would ultimately
swallow up all the advantages of civilization. The
selective influences by which our present high level
has been reached and maintained may well be modified,
but they must not be abandoned or reversed
in the rash expectation that State education, or
State feeding of children, or State housing of the
poor, or any amount of State socialism or public
or private philanthropy, will prove permanently
satisfactory substitutes. If ruinous deterioration
and other more immediate evils, are to be avoided,
the race must still be to the swift and the battle to
the strong. The healthy Individualism so earnestly
championed by Mr. Spencer must be allowed free
play. Open competition, as Darwin teaches, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
its survival and multiplication of the fittest, must
be allowed to decide the battle of life independently
of a foolish benevolence that prefers the elaborate
cultivation and multiplication of weeds to the
growth of corn and roses. We are trustees for the
countless generations of the future. If we are wise
we shall trust to the great ruling truths that we
assuredly know, rather than to the seductive claims
of an alleged factor of evolution for which no
satisfactory evidence can be produced.</p>
